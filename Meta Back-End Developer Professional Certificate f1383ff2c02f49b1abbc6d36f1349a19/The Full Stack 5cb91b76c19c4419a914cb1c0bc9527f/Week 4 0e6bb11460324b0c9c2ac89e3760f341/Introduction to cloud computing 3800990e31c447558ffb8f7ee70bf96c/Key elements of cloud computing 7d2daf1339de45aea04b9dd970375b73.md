# Key elements of cloud computing

# Introduction

Cloud computing is a solution that allows you to host applications on the internet, making them accessible to everyone. In this video, you'll learn more about the key elements and services offered by public cloud providers and how they can benefit your applications.

# Computing Units

- Computing units are virtual machines that are available for on-demand deployment.
- You can choose computing units from two groups: cores and memories.
- Cloud computing units can be resized, meaning you can upgrade or downgrade the number of processing cores or memory as needed.
- Cloud providers offer a variety of processor cores and memories, including GPUs, for complex programs like data analysis or machine learning.
- You can install your preferred operating system and applications in these cloud computing units.
- Some computing units come with volatile storage, meaning data will be lost when the machine reboots.
- **To prevent data loss, it's essential to equip the computing unit with a permanent storage solution.**

# Storage

- A significant benefit of using cloud computing is the ability to purchase storage.
- Cloud computing providers offer storage solutions in a few ways, including purchasing gigabytes or terabytes to store application files or personal data.
- Object storage is another **solution** offered by public cloud providers, where you can upload and download files with an API.
- Object storage can store small or massive files, and the files can be made available to anyone with a unique URL and a timestamp signature.
- Cloud providers automatically backup data in redundant storage, reducing the risk of data loss due to hardware faults.

# Databases

- Most public cloud providers offer SQL, NoSQL, or time-series databases to store application data.
- Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.
- Examples of NoSQL databases are MongoDB, Cassandra, and DynamoDB.
- Examples of time-series databases are InfluxDB and Prometheus.
- With cloud computing, you can deploy fully managed database solutions compliant with popular database engines without any change in the application code.
- These databases can scale automatically and withstand substantial traffic loads, making it easier for you to manage your data.
- In-memory database solutions are also offered for super-fast data operations.
- Cloud providers offer specialized solutions to deal with big data.

# Machine-learning

- Machine-learning requires powerful computing units and GPUs for data modeling and training.
- With cloud computing, you can start using machine-learning at a cheaper cost.
- Cloud providers offer the latest hardware and software solutions that are efficient for machine-learning, natural language processing, voice processing, and more.

# Conclusion

Cloud computing is an excellent solution that allows you to spend more time on application development instead of managing hardware and infrastructure. 

In this video, you learned about some essential services offered by cloud computing providers and how they can help your application development life cycle.
