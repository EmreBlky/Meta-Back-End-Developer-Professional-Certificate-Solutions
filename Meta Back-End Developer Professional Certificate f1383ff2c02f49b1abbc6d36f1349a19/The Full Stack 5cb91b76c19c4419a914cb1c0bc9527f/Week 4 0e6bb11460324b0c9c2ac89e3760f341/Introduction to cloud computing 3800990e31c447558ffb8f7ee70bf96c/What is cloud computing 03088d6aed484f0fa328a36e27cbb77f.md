# What is cloud computing?

# Introduction

Cloud computing is a solution for hosting applications on the internet, making them accessible and allowing users to use computing resources from a cloud provider for quick solutions.

# Types of cloud infrastructure

## Public Cloud

- Available for everyone to use
- Pay-as-you-go style
- Providers host the servers and maintain the network
- Can use computing resources anytime and only pay for what you use
- Benefits: Managed services, on-demand pricing, quick availability, and scalability
- Can become expensive over time as usage grows

## Private Cloud

- Not accessible to everyone, only for authorized individuals
- Used for sensitive data that requires more security
- Offers everything necessary for internal applications to scale and perform properly
- Tailored solution with a subset of features compared to public cloud providers
- Benefits: Better security, control, scalability, and reliability
- Can be costly to set up and manage

## Hybrid Cloud

- A combination of private and public cloud infrastructure
- Public cloud connected to private clouds for the application to work correctly
- Less expensive than a private cloud but setting up can be complex
