# What does self-hosted, PaaS, SaaS and DBaaS mean?

# ****Introduction****

When it comes to using cloud tools, you have many different choices to pick from. In this reading, let's explore what these tools are and what they have to offer to fit your requirements. The tools discussed in this reading include: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and DBaas. But first, let’s establish what self-hosted means.

# Self-hosted

When you create a public or private cloud network and manage everything yourself, it is called a self-hosted cloud. It is expensive, requires a lot of effort and the initial cost to run it is high. Therefore, it's not a popular option for cloud computing. **But, it’s your only option when you deal with sensitive data, need extra security, or have a custom requirement that public cloud providers cannot fulfill.** In such cases, you need to use cloud tools. Let’s explore a few.

# ****IaaS****

IaaS or infrastructure as a service, is when a cloud provider offers you on-demand infrastructural units like: load balancers, servers, computing units, storage and virtualization so you can create the infrastructure required by your application.

With IaaS, you can completely control your infrastructure and set up everything to correctly host and serve your application. In this computing model, you can scale up or down at any time and pay only for what you use.

Popular IaaS include: AWS EC2, Google computing units, Digital Ocean and Azure virtual machines. You can read more about these in the additional resources of this lesson.

# PaaS

PaaS, or platform as a service, is a specialized cloud solution that has all the essentials to develop, build, host and run your application on the cloud. You don't manage the servers in this cloud computing model but you do use the solutions offered by the provider.

In PaaS, the cloud providers offer different services as APIs that you can use in your applications. These services include: database, caching, file storage and so on. PaaS makes things easier for you by providing scalable and managed services.  **This means you don’t have to build these commonly used components from scratch. Thus, you can focus more on building the application's core, business logic and growth.**

Meta is an example of a PaaS because it provides an API to use its proprietary services to developers who build applications only for Facebook users. Other popular PaaS solutions include: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Cloudflare, Google app engine and Microsoft Azure. You can read more about these in the additional resources of this lesson.

# SaaS

SaaS, or software as a service, is when an application is hosted on the cloud and allows you to use it online with an on-demand or pricing model. **Most web applications with a premium or freemium subscription model belong to this category.**

# DBaaS

DBaaS, or database as a service, is a cloud service provider that offers high-quality, managed database solutions with an on-demand pricing model to store and process data. Many popular SQL, NoSQL, and other database solutions are used in modern applications. Setting them up, managing, optimizing and scaling them can be tedious and time-consuming. DBaaS solutions make life easier for you because you don’t have to manually do all that.

# Conclusion

In this reading, you learned about a few different types of cloud computing models called IaaS, PaaS, Saas, and DBaaS and how they can help you to start developing your application in the cloud.
