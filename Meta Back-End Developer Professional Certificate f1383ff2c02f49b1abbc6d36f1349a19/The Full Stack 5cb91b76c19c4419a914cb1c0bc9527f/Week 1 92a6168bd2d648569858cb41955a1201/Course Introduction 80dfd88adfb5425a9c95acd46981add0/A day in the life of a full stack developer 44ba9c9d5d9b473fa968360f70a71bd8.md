# A day in the life of a full stack developer

Contrary to popular belief, software engineering involves much more than just typing away in a dark room. In a corporate setting, communication and collaboration play a significant role in building software.

# ****My Experience as a Software Engineer****

My name is Dez and I work as a software engineer at the Meta office in DC. Our bottom-up culture requires us to align with various teams across the company, which means a lot of time is spent on written communication and design documents to make sure everyone is on the same page.

The programming language I work with is called Hack, but unlike other languages, we don't expect anyone to know it before joining the company. This allows for equal opportunity for everyone to learn and grow. However, the extra overhead in communication can cause challenges in balancing risk and being nimble and fast.

## **Problem-Solving and Teamwork**

As a software engineer, it's important to be able to break down problems into manageable and solvable pieces. This requires collaboration with teams, both internal and external, to achieve bigger problems in an efficient way.

## **Career Progression**

Every software engineer is expected to grow into a leader. At Meta, we have a career progression for engineers, starting with task-based work and gradually transitioning to driving projects and helping others grow in their careers.

## **Final Thoughts**

Being a software engineer can be fulfilling, but it may feel difficult initially. Stick with it and see where your career takes you. Good luck with the rest of the course and hopefully, we'll see each other in the industry someday.
