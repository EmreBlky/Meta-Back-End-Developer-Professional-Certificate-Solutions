# Introduction to the course

In this course, you'll delve into the world of full-stack development and learn how to build end-to-end applications. As a full-stack developer, you'll be involved in every step of the project, from front-end to back-end development.

# What is Full-Stack Development?

Full-stack development refers to end-to-end application software development, meaning you'll be responsible for every aspect of a project. Let's take the example of a restaurant website. As a full-stack developer, you'll be responsible for building the front-end infrastructure where customers can browse and order menu items, as well as the back-end logic that connects the application to databases and other services.

# Course Content

The course is divided into the following modules:

## Module 1: ****Introduction to Full-Stack Development****

In this module, you'll learn about the roles and responsibilities of a full-stack developer and understand N-tier architecture.

## Module 2: Front-End Technologies

You'll dive into front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You'll learn about semantic HTML and basic forms, CSS and responsive layouts, and how to update an HTML document using JavaScript.

## Module 3: Django and Full-Stack Development

In this module, you'll learn how to use Django for full-stack development. You'll get the opportunity to build a full-stack application, including populating a Django model for a MySQL database, querying an API, and updating an HTML document with the results.

## Module 4: Production Environments and Scaling Web Applications

In this module, you'll learn about production environments, hosting solutions, and cloud computing. You'll also cover the challenges of scaling web applications.

## Final Project

The final project consists of several labs where you'll put your skills to the test and implement your code in a full-stack environment. You'll connect the back-end of the restaurant to a MySQL database, set up a booking API, and display available booking times.
