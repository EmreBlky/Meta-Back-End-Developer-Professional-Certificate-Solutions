# Module summary: Introduction to the full stack

Congratulations on reaching the end of Module One! You've just taken the first step in learning about full stack development. Let's take a moment to review what you've learned in these lessons.

# ****Reflecting on Your Goals****

You started the module by thinking about what you hope to gain from this course. You also read some suggestions on how to be successful in this course, such as setting daily goals, scheduling time to study and taking regular breaks. Remember, taking breaks is important to stay well-rested and focused.

# ****Understanding the Stacks****

Next, you explored the different stacks in application development: the front-end, back-end and data stacks. You learned about the programs and tools used in these stacks, such as Python, Django, and DRF for back-end development. A full stack contains everything needed to create an application's core, process data, and present it via APIs on web or mobile applications. **A full stack developer is skilled in all three stacks.**

# ****Full Stack Developer Tasks****

You learned about the typical tasks of a full stack developer, such as developing the back-end of applications, storing and processing data, creating and managing servers, and integrating with CI/CD workflows.

# ****N-Tier Architecture****

You also learned about N-tier architecture, where an application architecture is split into multiple tiers. This makes it easier to secure and scale the application, and fix problems or add new features. There are two types of N-tier architecture: 3-tier and 4-tier. 

In 3-tier architecture, the presentation, application, and data tiers are separated. 

In 4-tier architecture, a fourth tier, called the delivery tier, deals with caching and delivering front-end assets to the client.

# ****Client-Server Architecture****

Finally, you reviewed client-server architecture and its components. You also learned about the roles of the client and server in this architecture.

# **What's Next?**

You've successfully completed the introduction module of the course. Take the quiz to test your knowledge and then get ready for the next module where you'll learn about front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Well done!
