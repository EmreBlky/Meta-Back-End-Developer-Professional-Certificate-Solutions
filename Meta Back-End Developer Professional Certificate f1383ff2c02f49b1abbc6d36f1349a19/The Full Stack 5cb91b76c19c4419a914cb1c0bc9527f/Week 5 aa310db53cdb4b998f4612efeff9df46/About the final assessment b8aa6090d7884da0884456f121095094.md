# About the final assessment

In this course, your final graded assessment consists of three exercises and one final graded quiz.

# ****The purpose of the assessments****

The primary purpose of the assessments is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course.

Most importantly, they help you establish which topics you have mastered and which topics require further focus before completing the course. Ultimately, the graded assessments are designed to help you make sure that you can apply what you have learned.

# ****What to expect from the exercises and peer review****

You have encountered exercises, knowledge checks, in-video questions and other assessments throughout this course. Nothing in the exercises will be outside of the scope of what you have already learned, so you should be well-placed to succeed.

You will combine the skills and knowledge that you applied throughout the course and use them to:

- Connect the Little Lemon restaurant back-end to MySQL
- Set up a Little Lemon restaurant booking API
- Display the Little Lemon restaurant’s available booking times

These will all be assessed in the peer review submission.

# ****What to expect from the graded quiz****

The quiz tests only the topics covered throughout the course so there shouldn’t be any surprises. Please review the feedback on your answers and where necessary go back and work through the topics that you feel require your further attention.

Good luck!
