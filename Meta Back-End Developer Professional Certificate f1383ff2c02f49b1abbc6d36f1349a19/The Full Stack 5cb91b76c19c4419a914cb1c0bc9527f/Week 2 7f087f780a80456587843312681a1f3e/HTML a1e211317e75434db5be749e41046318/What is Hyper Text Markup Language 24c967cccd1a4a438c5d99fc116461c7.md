# What is Hyper Text Markup Language?

# ****Introduction to HTML****

- Have you ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes when you browse the internet on your phone or computer?
- As an aspiring developer, you are aware that the content on a web page is controlled by HTML and CSS.

# Understanding HTML

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language that is used to create web pages.
- It was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 and has since been maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
- HTML is simply a text file with a specific structure that consists of elements and tags, with a .html suffix.

# HTML Tags  and Elements

- HTML elements are created using opening and closing tags, enclosed in angle brackets.
- An example of a tag for a paragraph is **`<p>`** for paragraph, and it is closed with **`</p>`**.
- HTML elements usually have content inside them, and they can also contain other elements.
- Some elements can be empty or self-closing, such as the line break tag **`<br>`**.

# HTML in Action

- The browser reads the HTML document and displays the web page to the user in a basic format.
- If you want to control how the web page is displayed, you use CSS.

**Example:**

```python
<img src="icon.png">
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```
