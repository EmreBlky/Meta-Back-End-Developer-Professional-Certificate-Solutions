# CSS web layout

CSS or cascading style sheets is a set of rules that enhance the appearance of web pages. It provides designers with creative freedom and control over the visual design of web pages. CSS has evolved over time, including the introduction of responsive design and various layout options such as flex boxes, grids, and blocks.

# What is CSS Layout?

The CSS layout is all about organizing the content of a web page in a visually appealing way. It defines how the content should be displayed on the screen and adapts to different viewports, such as different screen sizes. The display property is an important part of CSS layout. It specifies the type of box to use for a given HTML element and determines if the box should be a block or an inline model.

# Overview ****of Flex Box and Grid Layouts****

Flex box and grid are two popular CSS web layouts that provide more flexibility and dimensionality compared to traditional block layout.

## Flex Box

Flex box, short for flexible box model, is a one-dimensional layout that arranges elements either in a column or a row along its axis. The flex box container can flex to shrink or expand, making it a flexible and responsive design.

### Example

```css
<div id="sample" style="display: flex;">
  <div style="background-color: lightblue;">Item 1</div>
  <div style="background-color: lightgreen;">Item 2</div>
  <div style="background-color: lightcoral;">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

### Output

```css
+--------+--------+--------+
| Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
+--------+--------+--------+
```

## Grid

CSS grid is a two-dimensional layout that creates a grid along both the row and column axes. It provides more advanced layout options, but can also lead to increased complications if the element rules are not defined systematically.

### Example

```css
<div id="sample" style="display: grid;">
  <div style="background-color: lightblue; grid-column: 1 / 2; grid-row: 1 / 2;">Item 1</div>
  <div style="background-color: lightgreen; grid-column: 2 / 3; grid-row: 1 / 2;">Item 2</div>
  <div style="background-color: lightcoral; grid-column: 1 / 3; grid-row: 2 / 3;">Item 3</div>
</div>
```

### Output

```css
+--------+--------+
| Item 1 | Item 2 |
+--------+--------+
| Item 3 |        |
+--------+--------+
```

## Note

There is no strict rule on choosing which layout to use, but in general, flex boxes are more suitable for creating flexible elements in smaller spaces, while grids are more suitable for large scale layouts.
