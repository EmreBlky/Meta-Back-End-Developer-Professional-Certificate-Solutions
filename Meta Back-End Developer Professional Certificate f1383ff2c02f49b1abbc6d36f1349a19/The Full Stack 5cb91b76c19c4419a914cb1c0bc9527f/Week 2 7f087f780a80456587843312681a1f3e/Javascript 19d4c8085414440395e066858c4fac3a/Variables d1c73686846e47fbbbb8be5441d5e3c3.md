- Variables are an important part of programming in JavaScript and they allow you to store and reuse data

# Variable Declaration and Assignment

- To declare a variable in JavaScript, use the **`var`** keyword followed by the variable name and a semicolon

```

# Reassigning Variables

- Variables can be reassigned with new values at any time

**Example:**

```css
person = "James";
console.log("Hi", person);
```

# Conclusion

- Variables in JavaScript allow you to store and reuse data, making your programs versatile
- Variables can be declared using the **`var`** keyword, assigned a value using the assignment operator **`=`**, and outputted using the **`console.log`** method
