# Booleans

# Introduction

The Boolean data type is used in JavaScript to determine if a statement is true or false. It is a crucial part of the language and is often used for comparison purposes.

# Comparing numbers

In JavaScript, you can use various comparison operators to compare numbers and determine if a statement is true or false. Some common comparison operators include:

- Less than: <
- Greater than: >
- Equality: ==
- Strict Equality: ===
- Inequality: !=
- Strict Inequality: !==

Let's look at some examples:

- 1 < 2 returns **`true`**
- 1 > 2 returns **`false`**
- 1 == 2 returns **`false`**
- 100 == "100" returns **`true`** (only checks the value)
- 100 === "100" returns **`false`** (checks both value and type)
- 1 != 1 returns **`false`**
- 1 !== "1" returns **`true`** (checks both value and type)

# Using Parentheses

You can also use parentheses to control the order of calculations in JavaScript. For example:

- 2 * 4 + 8 returns **`16`** without parentheses
- (2 * 4) + 8 returns **`24`** with parentheses

# **Conclusion**

In this video, we covered the basics of the Boolean data type in JavaScript and how to use comparison operators to determine if a statement is true or false. We also touched on the use of parentheses in controlling the order of calculations. This knowledge is a foundation for further understanding how to use JavaScript.
