# Numbers

# Introduction

- JavaScript has a number data type that represents both integer and decimal point numbers.
- The number data type is a crucial part of JavaScript as a programming language.

# ****Demonstrating the Number Data Type****

- Example 1: Enter **`123`** into the console and press Enter. Output: **`123`**.
- Example 2: Enter **`123.456`** into the console and press Enter. Output: **`123.456`**.

# ****Using Numbers for Math Operations****

JavaScript provides several mathematical operators to perform operations on numbers. Here are some of the most common operators:

- Addition: **`+`** symbol
    - Example: **`2 + 2`** returns **`4`**.
- Subtraction: `**-**` symbol**``**
    - Example: **`4 - 2`** returns **`2`**.
- Multiplication: **``** symbol
    - Example: **`4 * 4`** returns **`16`**.
- Division: **`/`** symbol
    - Example: **`16 / 4`** returns **`4`**.
- Exponential: **`**`** symbol
    - Example: **`10 ** 2`** returns **`100`**.
- Remainder/Modulus: **`%`** symbol
    - Example: **`9 % 8`** returns **`1`**.
    - Example: **`16 % 8`** returns **`0`**.

# ****Using Parentheses for Complex Calculations****

- Parentheses can be used to group more complex calculations and control the order of calculations.
    - Example: **`2 * (4 + 8)`** returns **`24`**.
    - Example: **`2 * 4 + 8`** returns **`16`**.

# Conclusion

- The number data type is a crucial part of JavaScript as a programming language.
- JavaScript provides several mathematical operators to perform operations on numbers.
- Parentheses can be used to group more complex calculations and control the order of calculations.
