# Operators

- Comparison operators are used to compare and return a logical value based on the comparison.
- The following are the comparison operators:
    - Greater than: >
    - Less than: <
    - Equal to: ==
    - Not equal to: !=
- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values in programming.
- In this video, you will learn about the two types of operators: assignment and logical operators and their use in JavaScript.

# Assignment Operators

- Assignment operators are used to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The following are the assignment operators and their respective symbols:
    - Addition: +
    - Subtraction: -
    - Multiplication: *
    - Division: /

## Examples

1. Adding two numbers using the addition operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let a = 2 + 2;
    console.log(a); // Output: 4
    ```
    
2. Adding multiple numbers using the addition operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let b = 5 + 5 + 5;
    console.log(b); // Output: 15
    ```
    
3. Subtracting 18 from 20 using the subtraction operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let c = 20 - 18;
    console.log(c); // Output: 2
    ```
    
4. Multiplying 2 and 3 using the multiplication operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let d = 2 * 3;
    console.log(d); // Output: 6
    ```
    
5. Dividing 8 by 1 using the division operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let e = 8 / 1;
    console.log(e); // Output: 8
    ```
    

# Comparison Operators

- Comparison operators are used to compare and return a logical value based on the comparison.
- The following are the comparison operators:
    - Greater than: >
    - Less than: <
    - Equal to: ==
    - Not equal to: !=

## Examples

1. Checking if 3 is greater than 2 using the greater than operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let f = 3 > 2;
    console.log(f); // Output: true
    ```
    
2. Checking if 2 is less than 3 using the less than operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let g = 2 < 3;
    console.log(g); // Output: true
    ```
    
3. Checking if 10 is equal to 10 using the equal to operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let h = 10 == 10;
    console.log(h); // Output: true
    ```
    

# Logical Operators

- Logical operators are used to determine if something is true or false.
- The following are the logical operators:
    - AND: &&
    - OR: ||
    - NOT: !

## Examples

1. Checking if a variable named A is greater than 5 and less than 10 using the AND operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let A = 7;
    let result = A > 5 && A < 10;
    console.log(result); // Output: true
    ```
    
2. Checking if a variable named B is greater than 5 or greater than 10 using the OR operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let B = 11;
    let result = B > 5 || B > 10;
    console.log(result); // Output: true
    ```
    
3. Reversing the value of a logical expression using the NOT operator:
    
    ```jsx
    let C = true;
    let result = !C;
    console.log(result); // Output: false
    ```
    

# Conclusion

- Operators are essential in programming and used in many areas.
- By learning about assignment and logical operators, you have now added a must-have skill in your development toolkit.
