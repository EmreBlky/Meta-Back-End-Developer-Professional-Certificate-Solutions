# Exercise: Web page content update

In this reading, you will learn how to capture user input and process it. You'll be introduced to a simple example that demonstrates how to manipulate information displayed based on user input.

To capture user input, you can use the built-inÂ **`prompt()`**Â method, like this:

```jsx
let answer = prompt('What is your name?');
```

Once you have the user-provided input inside theÂ **answer**Â variable, you can manipulate it any way you need to.

For example, you can output the typed-in information on the screen, as anÂ **<h1>**Â HTML element.

Here's how you'd do that:

```jsx
let answer = prompt('What is your name?');
if (typeof(answer) === 'string') {
    var h1 = document.createElement('h1')
    h1.innerText = answer;
    document.body.innerText = '';
    document.body.appendChild(h1);
}
```

This is probably the quickest and easiest way to capture user input on a website, but doing it this way is not the most efficient approach, especially in more complex scenarios.

**This is where HTML forms come in.**

You can code a script that will take an input from an HTML form and display the text that a user types in on the screen.

Here's how this is done.

You'll begin by coding out a test solution to the task at hand:

```jsx
var h1 = document.createElement('h1')
h1.innerText = "Type into the input to make this text change"

var input = document.createElement('input')
input.setAttribute('type', 'text')

document.body.innerText = '';
document.body.appendChild(h1);
document.body.appendChild(input);
```

So, you're essentially doing the same thing as you did before, only this time you're also dynamically adding theÂ **input**Â element, and you're setting its HTMLÂ **type**Â attribute toÂ **text**. That way, when you start typing in it, the letters will be showing in theÂ **h1**Â element above.

However, you're not quite there yet. At this point, the code above, when run on a live website, will add theÂ **h1**Â element with the text **Type into the input to make this text change**, and an empty input form field under it.

You can try this code out yourself, for example, by pointing your browser to theÂ **example.com**Â website and running the above code in the console.

Another thing that you did in the code above is setting variables using theÂ `**var**`Â keyword.

Although it's better to use eitherÂ **`let`**Â orÂ **`const`**, you're just running a quick experiment on a live website, and you want to use the most lenient variable keyword, the one that will not complain about you having already set theÂ **`h1`**Â or theÂ **`input`**Â variables.

If you had a complete project with a modern JavaScript tooling setup, you'd be usingÂ **`let`**Â orÂ **`const`**, but this is just a quick demo, so usingÂ **`var`**Â in this case is okay.

The next thing that you need to do is set up an event listener. The event you're listening for is theÂ **`change`**Â event. In this case, the change event will fire after you've typed in the input and pressed the ENTER key.

Here's your updated code:

```jsx
var h1 = document.createElement('h1')
h1.innerText = "Type into the input to make this text change"

var input = document.createElement('input')
input.setAttribute('type', 'text')

document.body.innerText = '';
document.body.appendChild(h1);
document.body.appendChild(input);

input.addEventListener('change', function() {
    console.log(input.value)
})
```

This time, when you run the above code on the saidÂ **example.com**Â website, and you subsequently type some text into the input field and press the ENTER key, you'll get the value of the typed-in text logged to the console.

Now, the only thing you still need to do to complete the code is to update the text content of theÂ **`h1`**Â element with the value you got from theÂ **`input`**Â field.

Here's the complete, updated code:

```jsx
var h1 = document.createElement('h1')
h1.innerText = "Type into the input to make this text change"

var input = document.createElement('input')
input.setAttribute('type', 'text')

document.body.innerText = '';
document.body.appendChild(h1);
document.body.appendChild(input);

input.addEventListener('change', function() {
    h1.innerText = input.value
})
```

After this update, whatever you type into the input after pressing the **`ENTER`** key will be shown as the text inside theÂ **h1**Â element.

Although this completes this lesson item, it's important to note that combining DOM manipulation and event handling allows for some truly remarkable interactive websites.
