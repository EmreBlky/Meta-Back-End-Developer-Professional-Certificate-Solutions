# Module summary: Introduction to Django

Congratulations, you've completed this module on an introduction to Django!

In this module, you learned about:

- What Django is and the problems it solves, such as building projects that require high volumes of text content, media files, and heavy traffic. You also learned about real-world examples of where Django is used.
- Creating a project in VS Code using Windows or Linux.
- The core concepts of projects and apps, the importance of structuring a project for easier development, and how to get a default web project up and running.
- Best practices for developing projects in a structured way, such as the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Admin and structures, including the Django admin and manage.py commands for performing administration tasks and the differences between projects and apps.
- Web frameworks and the benefits of using a framework, such as speed, features, security, and scalability.
- The MVT (Model View and Template) architecture, which separates the data, logic, and display in web development, and how Django implements it.

You now have a solid foundation in Django development, including knowledge of the project structure, the use of the Django admin and manage.py commands, and the MVT architecture. Well done!
