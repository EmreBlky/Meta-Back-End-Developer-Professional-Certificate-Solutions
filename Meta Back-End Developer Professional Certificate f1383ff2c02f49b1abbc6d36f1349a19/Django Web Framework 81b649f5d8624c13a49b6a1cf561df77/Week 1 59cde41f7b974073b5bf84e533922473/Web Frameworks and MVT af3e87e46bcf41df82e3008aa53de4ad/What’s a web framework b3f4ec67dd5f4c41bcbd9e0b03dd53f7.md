# Understanding web frameworks

As an aspiring developer, starting a new web project can be confusing to understand why the project is structured in the way it is. In this video, you will learn about web frameworks, the benefits of using the Django framework, and the concept of the three-tier architecture.

## What’s a web framework?

- Frameworks are designed to support developers in building web applications.
- The purpose of a web framework is to make application development easier and provide developers with a clean structure that keeps things in order and allows for changes and modifications
- Frameworks also allow for code reusability facilitated by existing code.
- When building a web application, it's important to understand that many different pieces and components exist
- A static website can be built with just some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but for more complex functionality such as e-commerce, a back-end will be needed to handle things like user sign-in, payment transactions, and data management.

## ****Three-Tier Architecture****

- A web application can be split into two parts: the front-end and the back-end
- The front-end is the part of the website the user interacts with via the web browser
- The back-end is the part that runs on a web server and usually contains the database
- The three-tier architecture refers to splitting the back-end into three parts: presentation, application, and data.

## Choosing a framework

- Many options exist for building a back-end, but all frameworks share the **common goal of providing features to create a web application with a good structure.**
- A web framework can be thought of as a foundation to build upon, just like building a house
- Django is a popular choice, as it is a high-level free, open-source Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean design

## **Benefits of Using Django**

- Speed: Django reduces the amount of code to be written, allowing for quick application development
- Features: Includes many built-in features that can handle common web development tasks
- Security: Provides a secure layer of internal middleware to protect against common security mistakes
- Scalability: Allows data to be stored on other servers, providing flexibility and speed

# Conclusion

Now that you have a basic understanding of what a web framework is and why the Django framework is a popular choice for application development. You will explore its structure by learning about the three-tier architecture.
