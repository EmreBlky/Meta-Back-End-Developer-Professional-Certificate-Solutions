# Permissions

# Introduction

- In this video, you will learn about user and model permissions in Django
- Django has an in-built system for handling permissions for both authentication and authorization

# Classification of Users in Django

- Superuser: top level user or administrator of the system, has permission to add, change, or delete other users and perform operations on all data in the project
**Example in Django Shell:**
    
    ```python
    python3 manage.py shell
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    
    user = User.objects.create_superuser(
        username='admin',
        password='password',
        email='admin@example.com'
    )
    ```
    
- Staff User: allowed to access Django admin interface, but permission to create, read, update, and delete data must be given explicitly
**Example in Django Shell:**
    
    ```python
    python3 manage.py shell
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    
    user = User.objects.create_user(
        username='staff',
        password='password',
        email='staff@example.com'
    )
    user.is_staff = True
    user.save()
    ```
    
- Regular User: not authorized to use the admin site, marked as active by default.
**Example in Django Shell:**
    
    ```python
    python3 manage.py shell
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    
    user = User.objects.create_user(
        username='user',
        password='password',
        email='user@example.com'
    )
    ```
    

# Permission Mechanism in Django:

- Handled by the django.contrib.auth app
- You can create a new user object using the create user function
- To grant the staff status, set the user is staff property to true
- To create a superuser, use the command directly inside the Django shell

```python
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

# Model Permissions in Django

- As you create models, Django automatically creates add, change, delete and view permissions
- Permissions are named using the app action model pattern (e.g. myapp.add_mymodel, myapp.change_mymodel, myapp.delete_mymodel, myapp.view_mymodel)
**Example:**
    
    ```python
    class MyModel(models.Model):
        # model fields
        
        class Meta:
            permissions = [
                ("add_mymodel", "Can add mymodel"),
                ("change_mymodel", "Can change mymodel"),
                ("delete_mymodel", "Can delete mymodel"),
                ("view_mymodel", "Can view mymodel"),
            ]
    ```
    
- You can check if a user has a certain permission using the has_perm function
**Example:**
    
    ```python
    if user.has_perm('myapp.change_mymodel'):
        # allow user to change mymodel
    else:
        # raise permission denied error
    ```
    

# Groups in Django

- A group is a list of permissions that can be assigned to one or more users
- A user can belong to any number of groups
- When creating or modifying a user, you can choose the desired group and all the permissions listed in the group will be automatically assigned
- You can still manually add permissions to users, even if they belong to a group

# Conclusion

- In this video, you learned about user and model permissions in Django
- You can give permissions to a user while creating it in the admin panel or from the shell interface
- Using groups is a convenient way of enabling similar sets of permissions to multiple users
- You can enforce a permission while executing a view function using the permission required decorator
