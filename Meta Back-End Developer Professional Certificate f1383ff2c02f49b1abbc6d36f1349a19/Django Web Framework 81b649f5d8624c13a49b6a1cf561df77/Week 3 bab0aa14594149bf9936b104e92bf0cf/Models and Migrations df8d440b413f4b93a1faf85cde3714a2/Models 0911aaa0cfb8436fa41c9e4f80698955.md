# Models

# Overview of Models

When building a dynamic application, data storage is essential and the best way to achieve this is by using a database. The presentation layer is the layer where the user interacts with, and any data posted from this layer needs to be persisted for later use. In Django, a model is an object equivalent of a database table and acts as the single definitive source of information about the data.

# What are Models in Django?

Models in Django are Python classes that **represent a database table and the fields within it.** They are an integral part of the MVT (Model-View-Template) architectural pattern and are used to interact with the database.

- **Each attribute of the model represents a database field.** This means that instead of having to write a custom query for adding and retrieving database records, you can use a model to do it instead. Django gives you an automatically generated database access API to access the database with Python code.

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple model for a `User` table:

```python
from django.db import models

class User(models.Model):
		first_name = models.CharField(max_length = 255)
		last_name = models.CharField(max_length = 255)
```

This creates a **`User`** model with a **`first_name`** and **`last_name`** fields, both of which are of type **`CharField`**. The **`max_length`** argument limits the number of characters that can be stored in the field.

- Essentially, you can think of a model as a Python object and models help developers create, read, update, and delete objects, commonly called the **crud operations.**

# How to create a Model in Django

Let's explore a scenario to create a table called user, starting with SQL syntax and then using Django models. You may recall that to create a table in a database using SQL, you would need to write a query using the create table syntax. When the code runs, a table called user will be created with three columns, ID, first name, and last name.

```python
CREATE TABLE user (
		id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
		first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
		last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
		PRIMARY KEY(id)
);
```

To do this using a model in Django, you define a class that will subclass the django.db.models.model

```python
from django.db import models

class User(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

# CRUD Operations with Models

Django provides several built-in methods for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on models.

## Create

To create a new record in a table, you can create a new object from the corresponding model and call the **`save()`** method.

```python
user = User(first_name = "John", last_name = "Doe")
user.save()
```

## Read

To retrieve information from a table, you can use the model's objects manager. 

**The objects manager is available on every model and allows you to retrieve all records, filter by specific fields, and order the results.** 

Here's an example to get all the users from the User table:

```python
users = User.objects.all()
```

## Update

To update a record in a table, you can retrieve an object using the objects manager, change its attributes, and call the **`save()`** method.

```python
user = User.objects.get(id=1)
user.first_name = "Jane"
user.save()
```

## Delete

You can delete a record by fetching it and calling the delete() method. For example, you could delete a user like this:

```python
user = User.objects.get(pk=1)
user.delete()
```

# Migrations

It's worth noting that, although these methods provided by Django simplify working with the database, you need to use something called migrations to create and modify the database schema. Migrations handle creating and modifying database tables and fields based on the models defined in your Django project.

Additionally, Django also provides additional methods and functions to perform more complex queries, such as using related fields and other query conditions, retrieving specific fields, and pagination. These methods and functions can be used to retrieve information from the database, such as filtering, ordering, and joining tables, in a very efficient and optimized way.

With this you can easily create, read, update, and delete records in a database in Django by using the models.
