# Object Relationship Mapping - ORM

# What is ORM?

Usually, the type of system used in an Object-Oriented language such as Python contains types that are non-scalar and every time, they cannot be represented only in primitive types such as integers and strings.

On the other hand, data types in tables of a relational database are of primary types, that is integer and string.

Therefore, the program needs to convert objects in scalar data to interact with a backend database.

Object-oriented programming languages use Object Relation Mapping (ORM) to interact with Structured Query Language (SQL), both of which are incompatible.

The ORM layer maps a class to a table in a relational database, with its attributes matching the table's field structure.

The ORM library lets you perform the database operations in an object-oriented way instead of executing raw SQL queries.

**This allows you to focus more on the programming logic than the backend database operations.**

Object Relational Mapping or ORM is the ability to create a SQL query using object-oriented programming language such as Python. **This enables a quick turnaround time in fast production environments that need constant updates.**

Each model is a Python class that subclasses **`django.db.models.Model`**

Each attribute of the model represents a database field.â€¯Essentially you can think of a model as a Python object, and models help developers create, read, update and delete objects, commonly called the CRUD operations.

Django has its own ORM layer. Its migration mechanism propagates the models in database tables.

You need to construct a **`QuerySet`** via a Manager of your model class to retrieve objects from your database.

## Simpler

In simple terms, ORM maps the classes in your code to tables in a database. Each attribute of the class represents a column in the table, and the ORM library allows you to perform database operations (like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records) using simple object-oriented methods, instead of writing raw SQL queries.

### Example

For example, consider a simple application that keeps track of a list of books. 

In the application, you have a Book class with attributes like title, author, and ISBN. Using ORM, you can map this class to a table in a relational database, with columns for each attribute. Then, instead of writing raw SQL queries to insert, update, or retrieve data from the table, you can use simple methods like **`book.save()`** or **`Book.objects.all()`**.

> Django, a popular web framework for Python, has its own ORM built-in, and it also provides a migration mechanism for propagating the models in the database tables. This allows developers to focus on the programming logic and not worry about the backend database operations.

# QuerySet

Let's try to understand how **`QuerySet`** is constructed and handled with an example. To begin with, add the following models in the Django app named **demoapp**.

```python
from django.db import models  

class Customer(models.Model): 
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255) 

class Vehicle(models.Model): 
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255) 
    customer = models.ForeignKey( 
        Customer, 
        on_delete=models.CASCADE, 
        related_name='Vehicle' 
    )
```

The idea is to create two tables, Customer and Vehicle, with a one-to-many relationship. Apply the migrations and you will see these two tables in the project's database.

**Next, open the Interactive shell.**

It is important to know that these commands are the same if you are on Windows or Mac.

## ****(djenv) C:\djenv\demoproject>python manage.py shell****

Create an object of the Customer class. Give a string parameter to the constructor. The **`save()`** method of the **`models.Model`** class creates a row in the Customer table.

```python
>>> from demoapp.models import Customer 
>>> c=Customer(name="Henry") 
>>> c.save()
```

## ****Adding a model object****

The **`Customer.objects`** gives the Manager of the model. It handles all the CRUD operations on the database table. For example, an object can also be created with the **`create()`** method as follows:

```python
>>> Customer.objects.create(name="Hameed") 
<Customer: Customer object (2)>
```

The **`create()`** method actually performs the **`INSERT`** operation of SQL.

<aside>
ðŸ¤” **Both commands work the same, but with the second command, developers can create and save new records with less code and less lines.**

</aside>

Now, let us add two objects to the Vehicle model. 

Note that one of the fields in the Vehicle model refers to an object of the Customer table as **ForeignKey**. Fetch the Customer object with a primary key = 2.

```python
>>> from demoapp.models import Customer, Vehicle  
>>> c=Customer.objects.get(pk=2) 
>>> c.name 
'Hameed'
```

This object is used as the value of the customer attribute in the Vehicle object.

```python
>>> v=Vehicle(name="Honda", customer=c) 
>>> v.save() 
>>> v=Vehicle(name="Toyota", customer=c)   
>>> v.save()
```

Similarly, add two vehicles for Customer "Henry".

```python
>>> c=Customer.objects.get(name="Henry") 
>>> Vehicle.objects.create(name="Ford", customer=c) 
<Vehicle: Vehicle object (3)> 
>>> Vehicle.objects.create(name="Nissan", customer=c) 
<Vehicle: Vehicle object (4)>
```

## ****Fetch model objects****

A **`QuerySet`** represents a collection of objects from your database. It represents a **`SELECT`** query. To fetch all the objects, use the **`all()`** method of the Manager.

```python
model.objects.all()
```

The **`all()`** method returns a list of objects. You can iterate over it with the usual for loop or list comprehension technique.

```python
>> customers =Customer.objects.all()  
>>> [c.name for customer in customers] 
['Henry', 'Hameed']
```

You can apply filters to the data fetched from the model. This is used to fetch objects satisfying the given criteria. In SQL terms, a **`QuerySet`** equates to a **`SELECT`** statement, it is like applying a **`WHERE`** clause.

```python
model.objects.filter(criteria)
```

For example, use the following statement to retrieve all the customers with names starting with '**H**'.

```python
mydata = Customer.objects.filter(name__startswith='H')
```

Similarly, you can retrieve the objects of the Vehicle model. Remember that the Vehicle object refers to a customer object. You can retrieve the attributes of the related customer as follows:

```python
>>> vehicles =Vehicle.objects.all() 
>>> for vehicle in vehicles: 
...     print (vehicle.name, " : ", vehicle.customer.name) 
...  
Honda :  Hameed 
Toyota :  Hameed 
Ford :  Henry 
Nissan :  Henry
```

## ****Updating and removing a model object****

To update an object, such as changing the Customer's name from Henry to Helen, assign a new value to the name attribute and save.

```python
>>> c = Customer.objects.get(name="Henry") 
>>> c.name="Helen" 
>>> c.save()
```

Similarly, the **`delete()`** method of the model manager physically removes the corresponding row in the model's mapped table.

```python
>>> c = Customer.objects.get(pk=4) 
>>> c.delete() 
(1, {'demoapp.Customer': 1})
```

This way, you can perform the CRUD operations on a database table using the **`QuerySet`** API instead of executing raw SQL queries.
