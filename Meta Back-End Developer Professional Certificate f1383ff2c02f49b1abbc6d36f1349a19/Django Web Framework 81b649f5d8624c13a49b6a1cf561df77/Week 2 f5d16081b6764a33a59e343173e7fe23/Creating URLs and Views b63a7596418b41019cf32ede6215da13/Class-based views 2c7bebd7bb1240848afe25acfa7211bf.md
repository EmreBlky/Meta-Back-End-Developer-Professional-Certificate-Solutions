# Class-based views

# Introduction

- Organizing code in a clean and easy to use manner is essential when working on a project.
- Frameworks and design patterns like MVT can help with this.
- In Django, views can present data to end users and the framework passes the HTTP request to the view function, expecting an HTTP response back.
- For more complicated application logic, Django offers class based views.

# Features of Class Based Views:

- Class based views allow you to use views as objects and are an alternative to function based views.
- They respond to HTTP requests using class instance methods, rather than conditional branching.
- This simplifies code and separates logic, making it easy to understand.
- Object oriented techniques like mixins and multiple inheritance can be used to extend functionality.

# Mixins

- Mixins are class based generic views that are more flexible than function based views.
- They can be thought of as a form of multiple inheritance, where one class derives from another class with similar attributes.
- Some common mixins developers use are create, list, retrieve, update, and delete.
- They can't be used on their own, but can be combined with other views.

# Benefits:

- By using class based views and mixins, developers can simplify their views and create reusable components.
- Mixins allow developers to factor code into reusable components, making it easier to maintain and expand the project.

It's important to note that when using mixins, they can't be all used together in the same view. You should pick only those that make sense for your application. Additionally, you can create your own custom mixins if the built-in ones do not suit your needs.

# Examples

Here's an example of a function based view in Django:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def my_view(request):
	if request.method == 'Get':
			return HttpResponse('Hello, GET request!')
	elif request.method == 'POST':
			return HttpResponse('Hello, POST request!')
```

Here's an example of the same functionality implemented using a class based view:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse
from django.views import View

class MyView(View):
	def get(self, request):
			return HttpResponse('Hello, GET request!')
	def post(self, request):
			return HttpResponse('Hello, POST request!')
```

As you can see, the class-based view is more organized and readable. Instead of using if-else statements to check the request method, we have different methods (get, post) for handling different types of requests. It also allows us to use the features of class-based views such as inheritance and mixins, to easily reuse and modularize code.

# Conclusion

Finally, using class based views can also help to increase the readability and maintainability of your code. With the use of class based views, you can encapsulate common functionality in a single class or mixin, making it easier to find and understand how the code works. This is especially useful in large projects where many different views are used to handle different types of requests. 

In summary, class based views are a powerful tool that allows you to simplify your views by using object oriented techniques such as inheritance and mixins. They can help you to increase the readability and maintainability of your code, making it easier to understand and work with as your project grows in size and complexity.
