# Exercise: Add the registration page

# Overview

So far, you have built the **`Menu API`** and **`Table booking API`** in your app.

In this exercise, you will add the feature of registering a new user in your Django project.

# ****Scenario****

The objective of this exercise is to be able to add a new user, and modify the existing user's credentials from within the app instead of the admin interface.

You will use the **Djoser** authentication library. Using the views defined in this library, you can easily implement registration, login and logout actions.

# ****Steps****

## **Step 1**

Install the **`djoser`** library in the current Django environment with PIP.

<aside>
ðŸ¤” **Note:** You should already have Django REST framework installed.

</aside>

## **Step 2**

Add the code **`'djoser'`** to the **`INSTALLED_APPS`** list in the **`settings.py`** file. Ensure that it is placed after theÂ **`'rest_framework'`** app in the list.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "django.contrib.admin",
    "django.contrib.auth",
    "django.contrib.contenttypes",
    "django.contrib.sessions",
    "django.contrib.messages",
    "django.contrib.staticfiles",
    "restaurant",
    "rest_framework",
    "rest_framework.authtoken",
    **"djoser",**
]
```

## Step 3

Add a new section in the **`settings.py`** file to set the **`DJOSER`** variable.

```python
#add the following line
DJOSER={"USER_ID_FIELD":"username"}
```

## **Step 4**

Make sure that the **TokenAuthentication** and **SessionAuthentication** classes are added to the **DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES** section in the **REST_FRAMEWORK** setting.

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ]
}
```

## Step 5

Enable **djoser** endpoints by adding the following URL routes in the project's URL patterns.

```python
#add following lines to update urlpatterns list
path('auth/', include('djoser.urls')),
path('auth/', include('djoser.urls.authtoken'))
```

## Step 6

Run the migrations. Start the server and Login to the admin site with the superuser username and password. You should notice the **`Tokens`** section on the dashboard.

## **Step 7**

Visit the **Browsable API URL User List** â€“ Django REST framework to get the list of users already registered.

```python
http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/users/
```

## **Step 8**

Next you must register new user. ****To add a new user, use the form and submit a POST request.

```python
email: test@littlelemon.com
username: testuser
password: test@123!
```

## **Step 9**

To login, visit the **`djoser`** generated URL **http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/token/login/**.

Enter the username and password to obtain the token.
