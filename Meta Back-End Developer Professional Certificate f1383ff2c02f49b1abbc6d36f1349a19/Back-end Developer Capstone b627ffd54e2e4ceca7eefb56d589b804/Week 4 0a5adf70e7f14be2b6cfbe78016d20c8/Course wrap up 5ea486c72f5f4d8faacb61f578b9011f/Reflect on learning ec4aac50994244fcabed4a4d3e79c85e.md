# Reflect on learning

Reflecting on my learning experience in the Capstone Project course, I would say that I found the entire course to be incredibly valuable. The course was very well structured and provided a comprehensive overview of what is involved in building a back-end application.

The most interesting aspect of the course for me was the hands-on experience of building the Little Lemon Restaurant website. I was fascinated by the process of putting all the pieces together, from setting up the database to testing the API. I also found it particularly interesting to see how the various components of the project interacted with each other, such as the models, views, and templates.

The most challenging part of the course for me was actually implementing the templates and understanding the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code from the "Full Stack" course. Despite the challenges, I found the process of overcoming them to be very rewarding and it has given me a deeper appreciation for the importance of front-end design in web development.

I enjoyed the entire course but if I had to choose, I would say that the highlight for me was the experience of working with Django. I loved how intuitive and easy it was to work with and I was really impressed by its versatility and the wide range of functionalities it offers.

Going forward, I would like to learn more about Django and how I can use it to build more complex applications. I would also like to learn more about front-end design and how I can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a more engaging and dynamic user experience.

In conclusion, I would say that the Capstone Project course was an amazing experience and I feel so grateful for the opportunity to have taken it. It has given me a deeper appreciation for back-end development and I feel confident that I have the skills and knowledge I need to take my journey as a back-end developer to the next level.
