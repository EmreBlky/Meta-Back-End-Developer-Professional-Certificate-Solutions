# ****Well Done! You've Completed Your Journey****

Congratulations! You've reached the end of the capstone project course and have made remarkable progress in your journey as a back-end developer. This course reinforced and demonstrated your learning and practical development skills that you've gained throughout this program. 

You've built a relatively complex app, mimicking real-world use cases and requirements, and showed off your multiple skills in composing a modern back-end application for Little Lemon Restaurant.

# Reflect on your journey

Take a moment to reflect on your journey and what you've achieved. Consider the previous courses you've completed and how they tie into this course. Think about the knowledge you needed to complete the course and reflect on the process of building this project. You might ask yourself questions like:

- What were the hardest parts of the project?
- What were the easiest parts?
- What experience did I gain from building the project?
- Would I benefit from revisiting previous courses or taking them again?

You might have found most of the exercises and tasks easy and ready for bigger challenges. This positions you nicely for the next course in the program, "Coding Interview Prep," to prepare you for entering the development world as a working professional.

# ****Recognize Your Skills****

Remember, you've developed a wide range of skills in each of the back-end development courses. 

Now that you've applied everything you've learned and built a fully functional website using Django, you're ready for the next step in your journey. 

Why not register for the next course and continue to develop your skills? Once you've completed all the courses, you'll receive a certificate in back-end development, which is globally recognized and industry-endorsed evidence of your technical skills. Depending on your goals, you may choose to go deep with advanced role-based certifications or take other fundamental courses.

# ****Show Off Your Skills****

The project you completed in this course proves your knowledge and capabilities in back-end development. You now have a fully operational website built using Django that you can add to your portfolio. This not only demonstrates your skills and knowledge but also showcases your self-driven and innovative personality.

# Final Thoughts

Thank you for embarking on this journey with us. It's been a pleasure to watch you grow and achieve your goals. Best of luck in the future!
