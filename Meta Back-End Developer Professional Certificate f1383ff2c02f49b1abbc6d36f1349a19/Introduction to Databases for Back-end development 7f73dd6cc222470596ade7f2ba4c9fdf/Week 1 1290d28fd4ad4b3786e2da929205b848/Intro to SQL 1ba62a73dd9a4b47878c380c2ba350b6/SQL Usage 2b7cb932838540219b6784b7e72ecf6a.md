# SQL Usage

# Introduction

- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to interact with databases. It is particularly useful for working with relational databases, which require a language that can interact with structured data.
- Examples of relational databases that SQL can interact with include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server. A Database Management System (DBMS) is used to interpret and execute SQL instructions.

## CRUD Operations

CRUD operations are the most common task when working with a database. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations allow developers to add, retrieve, modify, and delete data in a database.

# SQL Subsets

SQL can be divided into several subsets or sub-languages, including:

- DDL (Data Definition Language): used to define data in the database, such as creating tables, modifying table structures, and removing objects.
- DML (Data Manipulation Language): used to manipulate data in the database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting data.
- DQL (Data Query Language): used to retrieve data from the database, such as using the SELECT command to select specific data fields based on filter criteria.
- DCL (Data Control Language): used to control access to data in the database, such as granting and revoking access privileges to users.

# Conclusion

Overall, SQL acts as the interface between the database and its users, allowing developers to perform various operations on the data stored in the database.
