- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language that can be used to interact with databases. It is particularly useful when working with relational databases, which are databases that store data in tables with defined relationships. Examples of relational databases that use SQL include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
- SQL is used to perform operations on databases such as creating, reading, updating and deleting data (CRUD operations). These operations are executed through a Database Management System (DBMS) which is responsible for interpreting SQL instructions and translating them into a form that can be understood by the underlying database.
- It is important for a data engineer to have knowledge of SQL as it allows them to interact with databases and work with data effectively. In this course, you will learn more about SQL and develop a deeper understanding of the language.
