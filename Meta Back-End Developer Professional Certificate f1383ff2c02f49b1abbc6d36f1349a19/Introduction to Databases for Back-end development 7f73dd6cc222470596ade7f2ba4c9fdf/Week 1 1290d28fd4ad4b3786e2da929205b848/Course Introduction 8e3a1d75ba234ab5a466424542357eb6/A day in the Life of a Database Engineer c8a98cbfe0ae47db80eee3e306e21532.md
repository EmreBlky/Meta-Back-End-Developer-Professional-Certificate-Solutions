# A day in the Life of a Database Engineer

# Introduction

- The text is written by a software engineer named Daniel Bloomfield Ramagem, who works for a company called Meta.
- The author begins by discussing the idea that technology is used to solve human problems, and that as a software engineer, it's important to keep this in mind when developing solutions.

# Whatâ€™s a database?

- The author uses the example of his mother's recipe book, which is a spiral notebook where she keeps her recipes and an index at the beginning, to explain that a database is simply a structured way of storing data.
- He goes on to say that databases are at the core of many applications, and that learning to create an effective data layer is critical for building applications.

# The role of a Database Engineer

- The author explains that as a Database Engineer, you are involved in a critical component of building applications, and have a large influence on the development of applications.
- He notes that technical skills such as coding and data pipeline creation are important, but that soft skills such as communication and organization are also essential.

# Common Technical Skills

- The author lists the technical skills he uses on a daily basis, such as programming using standard web programming languages and creating data pipelines.

# Common Soft Skills

- The author lists the soft skills he uses on a daily basis, such as communication and organization, and notes that these skills are just as important as technical skills.

# Avoid Over-complication

- The author advises that it's easy to over-complicate solutions, particularly when it comes to data modeling and data storage. He suggests starting small and iterating frequently, and being mindful of perceived needs for massive data scalability, which may lead to over-complicating solutions.

# Conclusion

The author concludes by reiterating that this course provides a comprehensive introduction to databases and is part of a program of courses that lead towards a career in back-end development.
