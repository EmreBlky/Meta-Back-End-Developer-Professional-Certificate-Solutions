# Introduction to Databases for Back-end development

# Introduction

- The course is an introduction to databases and their importance in global industry, government, and organizations.
- A database can be thought of as an electronic filing cabinet where data is stored, similar to how you would store documents in a physical cabinet.

# Real-world examples

Examples of how databases are used in real-world contexts:

- Banks use databases to store data for customers, bank accounts, and transactions.
- Hospitals store patient data, staff data, laboratory data, and more.
- Online stores retain customer profile information along with shopping history and accounting transactions.

# Big data

- With the increasing amount of data being generated by online services and social media platforms, and the Internet of Things (IoT), there has been a revolution in database technology to accommodate the volume, variety, and complexity of what has become known as big data.

# Database actions

Databases typically carry out the following actions, which developers must be familiar with:

- Store data
- Form connections or relationships between segmented areas of the data
- Filter the data to show relevant records
- Search data to return matching records
- Update, change, and delete data as required

# Course Outline

The course will explore the following concepts in more detail:

- Data and databases
- How data is related in the database
- Different database structures and their uses
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete)
- SQL operators to sort and filter data
- Database normalization and how to normalize a database
- Building a fully operational database

# Practice and support

The course includes:

- Installing and setting up software called stamp on your computer to help progress your local and remote database learning.
- Exercises and quizzes to consolidate your knowledge.
- Discussion prompts to connect with classmates

# Recommendations

To be successful in this course it is helpful to commit to a regular and disciplined approach to learning.

- It's recommended to map out a study schedule with dates and times that you can devote to the course.
- Even though the course is online and self-paced, it's important to think of your study as regular attendance at a learning institute.

# Summary

**In summary,** this course provides a comprehensive introduction to databases and is part of a program of courses that lead you towards a career in back-end development.

## Notes

- CRUD operations are the four basic functions of a database: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations are used to manipulate data within a database.
    - â€œCreate" refers to inserting new data into the database.
    - "Read" refers to retrieving data from the database.
    - "Update" refers to modifying existing data in the database.
    - "Delete" refers to removing data from the database.
