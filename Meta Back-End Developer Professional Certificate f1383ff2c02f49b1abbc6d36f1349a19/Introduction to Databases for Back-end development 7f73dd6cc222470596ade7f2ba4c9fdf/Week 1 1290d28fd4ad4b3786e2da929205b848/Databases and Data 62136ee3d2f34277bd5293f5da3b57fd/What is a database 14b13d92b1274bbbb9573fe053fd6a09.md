# "Introduction to Databases: Understanding Data and Database Structure‚Äù

# I. Introduction

- We use data and databases in our daily online lives. Examples include uploading photos to social media, downloading files at work, and playing games online.
- In this article, we will describe what a database is at a conceptual level, identify real-world examples of the use of databases, and demonstrate an understanding of how data is organized in a database.

# II. What is data?

- Data is facts and figures about anything. It can include information about a person (name, age, email, date of birth) or facts and figures related to an online purchase (order number, description, order quantity, date, customer's email).
- Data is crucial for individuals and organizations.

# III. What is a database?

- A database is a form of electronic storage in which data is organized systematically. It stores and manipulates data electronically to make it more manageable, efficient, and secure.
    - Analogies: A database is like a digital filing cabinet, where data is organized in a structured way, much like how physical files are organized in a physical cabinet.
    - Code example: A simple database can be created using SQL (Structured Query Language) commands, such as creating a table, inserting data, and querying data.

# IV. Real-world examples of Database Usage

- Banks use databases to store data for customers, bank accounts, and transactions.
- Hospitals use databases to store patient data, staff data, laboratory data, and more.

# V. How is Data Organized in a Database?

- Data is organized systematically, typically in a spreadsheet or table format.
- Systematic organization refers to the way data contains elements or features and attributes by which they can be identified. For example, a person can be identified by attributes like their age, height, or hair color.
- Data is separated and stored in entities that represent those elements. An entity is like a table and contains rows and columns that store data relating to a specific element.
- In the relational database world, these entities are known as relations or tables. The attributes become the columns of the table. Each table row represents an instance of that entity.
- Example: An online store could hold customer's data in a customer entity containing specific attributes relating to the customer. These attributes could include first name, last name, date of birth, and email. They could also have product data stored in a product entity against attributes like product code, description, price, and availability.

# VI. Different types of databases

- Relational databases are not the only kind of databases that you'll encounter.
- Other common examples include NoSQL databases, graph databases, and document-oriented databases.
- As a Database Engineer, you'll work with many different types of databases, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

# VII. Additional Information

- A database management system (DBMS) is software that interacts with the database to create, read, update and delete data.
- SQL is a standard programming language for managing and manipulating relational databases.
