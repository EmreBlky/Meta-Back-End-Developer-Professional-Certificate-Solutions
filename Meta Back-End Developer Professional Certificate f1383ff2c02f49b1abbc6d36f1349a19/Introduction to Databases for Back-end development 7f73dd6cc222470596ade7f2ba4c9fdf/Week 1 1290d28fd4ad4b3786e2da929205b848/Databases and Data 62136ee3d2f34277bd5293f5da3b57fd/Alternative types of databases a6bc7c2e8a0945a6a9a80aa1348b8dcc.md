# Alternative types of databases

# Introduction

The text explains different terms related to databases such as big data and cloud databases, and how databases have evolved in response to new trends.

# Background

## Relational Databases

- Relational databases have limitations when it comes to storing data because they mostly store structured data, but with the growth of the internet, they now must be able to store ever-increasing amounts of unstructured data.

## Big Data

- Big data is complex data that can increase in volume with time, it is highly unstructured or semi-structured, and is collected from many different sources.
- Big data is highly valued across many industries, for example, the manufacturing sector processes big data to predict equipment failure, assess production processes, respond to customer feedback proactively and anticipate future demands by monitoring current sales, retail processes.
- NoSQL databases are a type of database that store data in a variety of different formats, providing databases with a flexible structure, and are used by social media platforms, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and other applications that generate massive amounts of unstructured data.

## Types of NoSQL Databases

- Document databases
- Key value databases
- Graph databases

# Big Data and Cloud databases:

- Big data is a combination of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, it adds more power to data because it can address complex business problems that traditionally structured data can't handle.
- Big data helps to provide unique insights that can help to improve decision making.
- Cloud databases are databases that are hosted on cloud computing platforms, which allows for better scalability and cost-effectiveness for big data storage.

# Examples

- A retail company can process big data to anticipate customer demand, improve customer experience, analyze customer behavior and spending patterns, and identify pricing improvement opportunities.
- A telecommunications company can use big data analytics and network usage analytics to plan for infrastructure investments, design new services that meet customer demands, analyze service quality data, and optimize network performance.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, big data and cloud databases are becoming increasingly important as the amount of data being generated continues to grow. The use of NoSQL databases, which can store data in a variety of different formats, allows for more flexibility and scalability in handling big data. These databases have many uses in different industries, and their unique insights can help to improve decision making.
