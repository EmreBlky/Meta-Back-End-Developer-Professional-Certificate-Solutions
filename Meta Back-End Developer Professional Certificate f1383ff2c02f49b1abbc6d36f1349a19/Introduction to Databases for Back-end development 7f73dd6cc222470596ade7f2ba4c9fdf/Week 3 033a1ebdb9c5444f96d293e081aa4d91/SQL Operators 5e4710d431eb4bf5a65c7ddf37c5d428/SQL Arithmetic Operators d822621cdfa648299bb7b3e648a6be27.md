# SQL Arithmetic Operators

SQL arithmetic operators allow you to perform mathematical operations on data stored in a database. These operators include addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).

When performing a calculation, an operator takes two operands and returns a result. 

For example, an addition operator can take 5 as one operand and 10 as the other, and return 15 as the result. In SQL, you can use the SELECT statement to perform arithmetic operations by including the operands and the appropriate operator.

# Addition

For example, to add two numbers together in SQL, you would use the following syntax: 

```sql
SELECT 10 + 15;
```

This would return a result of 25. The same syntax can be used for subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations by replacing the + operator with the appropriate operator.

# Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are commonly used in SQL to perform calculations on data stored in a database, such as calculating salary increases or changes to allowances for employees. They allow you to manipulate data in a fast and efficient way, making it easy to retrieve important information from a large corporate database.

# Important

It's important to note that the operands used in SQL arithmetic operations must be numerical data types, such as integers or decimals. Attempting to use non-numerical data types, such as text strings, will result in an error. Additionally, make sure that the operands are properly formatted and syntactically correct to avoid any errors.

# Conclusion

In summary, SQL arithmetic operators are a useful tool for manipulating data stored in a database. They allow you to perform mathematical operations and retrieve important information in a fast and efficient way. By understanding how to use these operators, you can perform complex calculations on large amounts of data with ease.
