# Module Summary: Database design

Congratulations on completing this module on database design! You have now gained a comprehensive understanding of the key principles and skills required to design a well-structured and efficient database.

In the first lesson, you learned the importance of a correctly designed database schema and how it serves as the foundation for all subsequent data storage and analysis. You were also able to define the term "database schema" and describe the different types of schemas used in various database systems. Additionally, you practiced creating a basic schema using SQL and identifying the two main types of database schema.

Next, you explored the relational model for databases and learned how to design a relational database. You are now able to:

- Describe the relational model and its importance in database design
- List different types of relationships between tables
- Evaluate an entity-relationship diagram (ERD)
- Explain the purpose of primary and foreign keys in database tables, including selecting a single primary key or composite primary key
- Identify entities and their attributes, and create links between them

In the final lesson, you delved into database normalization, which is the process of converting a large table into multiple tables to reduce data redundancy. You now have the ability to:

- Explain database normalization and its importance
- Recognize and explain insert, update, and deletion anomalies
- Describe the concept of atomicity and repeating groups of data problems
- Design a database in first, second, and third normal forms
- Explain the concepts of functional, partial, and transitive dependency

Overall, you have acquired a solid understanding of the essential skills and concepts needed for database design and are now able to create a normalized, relational database structure. Well done on your progress and continued learning!
