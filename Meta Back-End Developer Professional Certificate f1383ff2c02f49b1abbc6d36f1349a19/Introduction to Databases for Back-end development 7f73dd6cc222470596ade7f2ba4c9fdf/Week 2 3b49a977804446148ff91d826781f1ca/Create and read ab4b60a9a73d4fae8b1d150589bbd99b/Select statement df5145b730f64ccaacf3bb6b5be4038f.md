# Select statement

# Introduction

In this text, we will be learning about the SQL SELECT statement and how it is used to retrieve data from a database table. The SELECT statement is an essential tool for database developers, as it allows them to query and retrieve data from a table in a database. The basic syntax of a SELECT statement includes the SELECT keyword, followed by the name of the column(s) that you want to retrieve data from, followed by the FROM keyword and the name of the table that you want to query.

# Example

For example, let's say we have a table called "players" in a soccer club database, which stores information about players such as ID, name, age, and skill level. To retrieve the `names` of all players, we can use the following SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT name FROM players;
```

This statement will return a results set with all the names of players stored in the "players" table, with each name on a separate row.

Additionally, we can retrieve data from multiple columns in a table by listing them after the SELECT keyword and separating them with a comma. For example, if we want to retrieve the name and skill level of each player:

```sql
SELECT name, level FROM players;
```

Alternatively, we can retrieve all data from all columns in a table by using the asterisk (*) as shorthand for listing all column names in the statement.

```sql
SELECT * FROM players;
```

In this text, we've covered the basics of the SQL `SELECT` statement and how it can be used to query and retrieve data from a database table. With this knowledge, you'll be able to retrieve the information you need from your database tables in an efficient and organized manner.
