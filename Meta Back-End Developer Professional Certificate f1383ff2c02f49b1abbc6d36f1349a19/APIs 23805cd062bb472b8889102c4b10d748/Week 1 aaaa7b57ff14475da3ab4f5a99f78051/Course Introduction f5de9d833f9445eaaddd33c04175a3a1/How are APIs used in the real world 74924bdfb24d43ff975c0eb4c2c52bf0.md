# How are APIs used in the real world?

## **Understanding APIs**

- APIs are an intermediary between an end-user and a back-end service
- They describe how software components interact with each other
- APIs are crucial for end-to-end full-stack developments

## **Designing an API**

- APIs are designed with a specific purpose in mind
- The design process involves collaboration between engineers, product managers, and designers
- Consider the end-user and the people accessing the data when designing an API
- Add a layer of security to preserve the integrity of the data

## **Tips for Aspiring Developers**

- Come at API design with an open mind and be prepared for a collaborative process
- Think about components as part of a larger piece
- Have fun and brainstorm with engineers to get a sense of the target architecture
- Remember to always consider the end-user and add a layer of security

## **The Importance of APIs**

- APIs allow us to interact with back-end services without directly accessing the data
- They are essential for rendering things like stories, photos, and videos in applications
- APIs play a crucial role in registering actions like double-taps on a post
