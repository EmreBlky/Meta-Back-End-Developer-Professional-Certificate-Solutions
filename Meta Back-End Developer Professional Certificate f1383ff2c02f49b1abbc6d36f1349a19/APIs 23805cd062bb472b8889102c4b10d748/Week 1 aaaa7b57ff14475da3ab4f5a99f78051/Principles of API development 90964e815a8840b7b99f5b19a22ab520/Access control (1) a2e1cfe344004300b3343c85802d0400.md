# Access control (1)

The Little Lemon API provides various APIs that allow you to view the details of an order. However, the output of these APIs may contain sensitive data such as customer delivery addresses which should not be visible to the public. To ensure the safety of this information, it is important to have a system in place to control access to your APIs.

# ****Roles and Privileges****

Roles and privileges are the building blocks of an access control system. A role is a collection of privileges and a privilege is the permission to perform a particular task. In the Little Lemon project, the customer role is made up of the following privileges:

- Browse menu items
- Add menu items to the cart
- Place orders
- Add food reviews
- Browse their own orders

The manager role, on the other hand, includes the following privileges:

- Add menu items
- Edit menu items
- Delete menu items
- Browse all orders
- Browse customer data
- Assign orders to delivery crew
- Browse transaction data

The delivery crew role only includes the following privileges:

- Browse orders assigned to them
- Update status of assigned order

There can be multiple roles in a project, such as administrators, senior managers, HR representatives, etc. The more specific and detailed the privileges are, the better the access control system can be designed.

# ****Authorization****

Authorization is another term for access control. It is important to note that authentication and authorization are two different things. Authentication allows a user to log in, while authorization allows them to perform certain tasks after authentication, or prevents them from performing certain tasks.

# Multiple roles for a User

In real-life projects, a user may perform multiple tasks that belong to different roles. For example, a general manager of the Little Lemon restaurant should be able to perform everything that an accountant, HR representative, and a normal manager can do. There are two approaches to dealing with this issue in API design:

1. Create one role with all the necessary privileges and assign it to the general manager. This way, the privileges can be updated or edited as needed.
2. Assign multiple roles to a user. For example, the accountant role only has access to accounting features, the HR team only has access to HR management features, and there is a separate manager role with relevant privileges. The general manager can have all three roles, giving them access to perform every task an accountant, HR representative, and manager can do.

# ****Importance of Access Control in API Design****

Effective access control is an essential component of API design. Taking the time to properly design and plan out your privileges and roles can save time and money in the long run by avoiding costly debugging and refactoring down the road. A well-designed API access control system is an asset to the entire project and helps ensure the security of sensitive information.
