# Module summary: REST APIs

Let's take a closer look at what you learned in this module about RESTful API development:

# Introduction to APIs

- You learned about the real-world applications of APIs, with a focus on the Meta software engineer Celina Florentin.
- You had a quick overview of HTTP and HTTPS, including how they work and the difference between them.
- You were reminded of the HTTP methods, such as PUT for updating a resource, and the HTTP requests and responses, as well as the commonly used status codes.

# **RESTfulness and Naming Conventions**

- You learned about REST as an architectural style for designing APIs and that it is only considered RESTful if specific constraints are met, such as being stateless.
- You learned about the importance of consistent naming conventions in APIs, as well as the technical requirements for naming, such as using nouns for resource names and forward slashes to indicate hierarchical relationships.

# **Essential Tools for API Development**

- You learned about Insomnia, a powerful free REST API client, and completed an exercise on setting up your tools and environment.

# **Principles of API Development**

- You learned about REST best practices, such as only supporting two versions of a resource, and the importance of API security, including token-based authentication and access control.

# **Start of a Project**

- You learned about organizing your project, including splitting a large Django app into smaller apps and creating a separate app for upgrades.
- You practiced creating your first API and learned about debugging Python scripts using the built-in tools in VS Code.
- You learned about API mocking, which is a great way to imitate a real API endpoint and can help in rapid API development.

# Conclusion

With this foundation, you are now ready to move on to the next module on securing an API in Django REST framework. Don't forget to review the additional resources and complete the quiz to solidify your understanding of these concepts.
