# Module summary: Django REST Framework

Congratulations on finishing the second week of the course! It's time to review what you've learned about using the Django Rest Framework (DRF) to create APIs, serialize your database models, convert, validate and render data.

# Lesson 1: Introduction to Django REST Framework

- You were introduced to the Django Rest Framework (DRF), a toolkit built on top of the Django web framework for creating APIs more efficiently.
- You learned about the benefits of using DRF, such as a built-in API viewer, human-readable HTTP status codes, and built-in serializers for data conversion.
- You learned how to install and configure DRF, and the benefits of using pipenv over pip.
- You learned about the API view decorator, different types of routers in DRF, and how to create function and class-based views.
- You also learned how to integrate the Django debug toolbar in your project and explore its different sections for debugging and performance tuning.
- You created a restaurant menu API project using DRF, where you could create, list, edit, delete and select menu items.
- Finally, you tested your skills by converting a book list API project to DRF.

# ****Lesson 2: Django Rest Framework Essentials****

- You learned more about serializers, including relationships serializers and how to display related data of connected models in the API output.
- You learned about deserialization techniques and how it helps you to validate the HTTP request body and map it to an existing model to store in the database.
- You learned about the built-in renderers in DRF, and how to display different types of content (JSON, XML, HTML).
- You completed an ungraded lab centered on a restaurant menu API, where you used serialization, validation and deserialization to display API data in JSON and XML format, and created HTML forms to add and modify menu items.

# Summary

After completing this week, you should be able to:

- Install and set up Django Rest Framework
- Use function and class-based views to create API endpoints efficiently
- Serialize database models using model serializers
- Convert and validate data using serialization
- Map user input to database models using deserialization
- Use throttling and caching to optimize and protect your API.

You should be proud of all the hard work you've done, and now you're ready to tackle the module quiz. Good luck!
