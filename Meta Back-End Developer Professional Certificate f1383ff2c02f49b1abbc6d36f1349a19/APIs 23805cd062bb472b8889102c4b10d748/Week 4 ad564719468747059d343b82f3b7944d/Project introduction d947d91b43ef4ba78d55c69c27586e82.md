# Project introduction

Congratulations on reaching this milestone! You've learned the ins and outs of REST API development and now it's time to put that knowledge to the test. You'll be building an API project for the Little Lemon Restaurant, which will be both fun and challenging. Let's get started!

# Project Overview:

- You will deal with three types of users: managers, customers, and the delivery crew
- User registration and authentication process
- API endpoints to assign users to groups (e.g. manager, delivery person)
- Manager role: only managers can add, edit, and remove menu items and update user to delivery person
- Customer role: browse menu items, filter by categories/price ranges, search menu items, add to cart, place order
- Delivery role: browse assigned orders, mark as delivered
- Throttling: limit to 5 API calls per minute

# Project Requirements:

- Use VS Code for code writing
- Use Django with Django REST framework (DRF)
- Work in a virtual environment
- Test and debug with Insomnia
- Only use packages and libraries learned in the course
- Token-based authentication only, comment out session authentication before submission

Good luck and have fun building the Little Lemon Restaurant API!
