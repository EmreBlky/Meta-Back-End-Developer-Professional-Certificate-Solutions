# Ordering

Sorting is a way to arrange the results of your API in a specific order based on a certain field. This video will demonstrate how to sort your API results in ascending or descending order using Django's native sorting methods.

# ****Setting up the query string****

To sort the API results, you'll need to add a query string parameter to the menu items endpoint. The query string should be in this format:

```python
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items?ordering=price
```

Here's an example of how you can retrieve the ordering query string parameter in your views.py file:

```python
@api_view(['GET', 'POST'])
def menu_items(request):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        #items = MenuItem.objects.all()
        items = MenuItem.objects.select_related('category').all()
        
        category_name = request.query_params.get('category')
        to_price = request.query_params.get('to_price')
        search = request.query_params.get('search')
        **ordering = request.query_params.get('ordering')**
        
        if category_name:
            items = items.filter(category__title = category_name)
        if to_price:
            items = items.filter(price = to_price)
        if search:
            items = items.filter(title__startswith = search)
        **if ordering:
            items = items.order_by(ordering)**
            
        serializer = MenuItemSerializer(items, many = True, context = {'request': request})
        return Response(serializer.data)
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        serialized_item = MenuItemSerializer(data = request.data)
        serialized_item.is_valid(raise_exception=True)
        serialized_item.save()
        return Response(serialized_item.data, status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
```

# Sorting in ascending order

To sort the results in ascending order, simply pass the query string to the menu items endpoint with ordering set to the desired field:

```python
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items?ordering=price
```

# Sorting in descending order

To sort the results in descending order, add a minus sign before the field in the query string:

```python
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items?ordering=-price
```

No changes are required in the views.py file, just pass the query string to the menu items endpoint with the minus sign and the results will be sorted in descending order.

# Sorting by multiple fields

To sort the results by multiple fields, pass multiple fields separated by a comma in the query string:

```python
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items?ordering=price,inventory
```

In your views.py file, split the value of the ordering query string by a comma and call the **`order_by`** method with that list:

```python
...
if ordering:
	ordering_fields = ordering.split(',')
	items = items.order_by(*ordering_fields)
```

# Sorting in ascending and descending order for multiple fields

To sort the results by multiple fields in both ascending and descending order, add a minus sign before the field in the query string for descending order:

```python
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/menu-items?ordering=price,-inventory
```

No changes are required in the views.py file, just pass the query string to the menu items endpoint with the minus sign for descending order and the results will be sorted accordingly.

# Conclusion

In this video, you learned how to sort your API results in ascending and descending order using Django's native sorting methods. You also learned how to sort the results by multiple fields in both ascending and descending order. Keep in mind that while the **`django-filters`** package offers advanced filtering, sorting, and searching, it is mainly used with class-based views.
