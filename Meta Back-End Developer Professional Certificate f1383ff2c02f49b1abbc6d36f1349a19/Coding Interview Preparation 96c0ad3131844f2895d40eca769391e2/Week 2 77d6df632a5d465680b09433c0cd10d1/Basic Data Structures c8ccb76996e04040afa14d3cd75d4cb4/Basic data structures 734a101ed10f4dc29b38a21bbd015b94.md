# Basic data structures

# **Introduction to Data Structures**

- Data structures are used to model objects for easy storage and organization in computer memory
- There are two main types of data structures: mutable and immutable
- Choosing the right data structure can have a significant impact on a project's success
- This video provides an overview of data structures, including the two main types: linear and nonlinear

# **Linear Data Structures**

- Linear data structures arrange elements one after another in the order they were inputted
- Examples of linear data structures include arrays, queues, stacks, and lists
- Some programming languages only allow for similar data types to be stored in the same structure, while others allow for mixed data types
- Accessing elements in a linear data structure is done through an index, which is represented by square brackets and an integer location
- Most programming languages have a built-in method for retrieving the length of a linear data structure (e.g. **`array.length`** in Java or **`len(array)`** in Python)
- Linear data structures are first-class objects, meaning they can be passed as parameters, returned as results, or assigned to variables
- However, care must be taken when passing a linear data structure to a function to avoid changing the original data structure
- Memory leaks can occur if memory is not deallocated, causing the program to crash over time

# **Nonlinear Data Structures**

- Nonlinear data structures do not allow for a smooth traversal of data
- Instead, specific paths can be investigated
- Examples of nonlinear data structures include trees and graphs
- Nonlinear data structures often include natural sorting, making querying for specific data quick

# Conclusion

- This video provided a general overview of data structures, including linear and nonlinear structures
- When choosing a data structure, it is important to consider the type of data and the desired outcome
- As you continue through the course, you will learn more about individual data structures and their strengths and weaknesses.
