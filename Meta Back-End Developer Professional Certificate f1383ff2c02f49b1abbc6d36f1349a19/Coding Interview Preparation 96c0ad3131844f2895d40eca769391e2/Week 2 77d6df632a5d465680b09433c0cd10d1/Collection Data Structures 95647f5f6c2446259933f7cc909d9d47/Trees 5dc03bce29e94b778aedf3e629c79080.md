# Trees

# Introduction

Trees are a powerful data structure that can provide great flexibility in adding, searching, and understanding the relationships between stored data. In this tutorial, you will learn about the general structure and features of trees, different types of trees, and the advantages of using a tree data structure.

# Tree Structure

- A tree is a complex data structure that resembles a tree design, consisting of nodes linked to each other.
- Nodes can be a parent node or a child node. A parent node can have a set of children nodes. Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.
- Nodes can branch off in different directions, allowing for powerful search and storage features.
- The general idea of a tree is a graph-like structure that has nodes that contain data and edges that model the relationship between each node.

# Terminologies

- Root: The top-level node is referred to as the root.
- Child node: Each subsequent node connected to the root is referred to as a child node.
- Siblings: Nodes that have the same parent are referred to as siblings and are considered to be on the same level.
- Path: A series of connected nodes is referred to as a path. The shortest path between two nodes is the quickest way to move from one node to another.
- Depth: The depth of a node refers to the number of edges from the parent to the root or the longest path.
- Height: The height of the tree refers to the number of edges between the topmost node to the deepest node within the structure.
- Size: The size of the tree refers to the total number of nodes within the tree.

# Types of trees

- Binary Trees: In binary trees, nodes have at most two children, a left node and a right node. The left node has a lesser value, while the right node has a greater value.
    
    ```python
           23
          /  \
         4    30
        / \   / \
       1  24 56  ...
    ```
    
- B Trees
- B-plus Trees
- Quad Trees
- AVL Trees

# Advantages of trees

- Store information in a hierarchical fashion, where the topmost content is stored in the upper nodes, and more in-depth information can be retrieved by traversing a given branch of the tree.
- Efficient for inserting and deleting data due to the flexible way they are implemented.
- Can be traversed in different ways, including depth-first and breadth-first methods.
- Can be used to model file systems, class hierarchies, or organizational hierarchies.
