# Stacks and queues in different programming languages

# Introduction

- A stack and a queue are two important data structures used in computer science and programming.
- They have different characteristics and principles when it comes to storing and accessing data.
- This guide will help you understand the differences between a stack and a queue and when to use each one.

# Stacks

## Definition

- A stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) data structure.
- Imagine a pile of plates on a washing board, where the last plate added to the pile is dried first, and the first plate is dried last.
- The basic operations of a stack include push, pop, peek, and count.
- In JavaScript, an array can be used as a container adapter to implement a stack, with the push and pop methods adding and removing elements from the top of the stack.

## Example

- An example of a stack in real life is your browser history, where each time you hit back, the previously visited page loads and adds it to the stack.

# Queues

## Definition

- A queue is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure.
- Imagine a line of people waiting to get a burger at a fast food restaurant, where the first person to enter the queue gets served first, and each subsequent customer stands behind the one in front.
- The basic operations of a queue include enqueue, dequeue, peak, pop, push, and size.
- In Swift, a queue can be implemented using an array as a container adapter, with the enqueue and dequeue methods adding and removing elements from the front of the queue.

## Example

- An example of a queue in real life is a customer service line, where each customer who arrives first will be helped first.
- Python implements several variant queue classes, including a synchronized queue and a priority queue, where elements can be assigned importance.

# Conclusion

- Choosing the right data structure for a task is a crucial programming decision that can affect the whole project.
- A stack is appropriate for keeping track of the order in which items are entered and accessing them in a specific way, while a queue is used for maintaining order but with different rules.
- A priority queue is used when assigning importance to elements in the queue.
