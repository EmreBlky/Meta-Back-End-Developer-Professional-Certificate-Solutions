# Hash tables in different programming languages

Hash tables are a popular data structure for quick lookups and storage of key-value pairs. Although not all programming languages have built-in implementations, it is possible to alter existing data structures to perform the operations of a hash table. This guide will cover the implementation of hash tables in Kotlin and Python.

# What is a hash table?

- A hash table offers quick lookups for an application by using a hashing function to create an alpha-numeric output from a given input (the hash).
- This hash is used to determine where in memory to store an item, allowing for fast searches without having to check every single entry in a potentially large data source.

# Implementing Hash Tables in Kotlin

- Kotlin does not have a built-in implementation of a hash table, but a similar data structure called a hash map is supported.
- Hash maps are similar to hash tables in terms of storing key-value pairs and using a hash to determine memory storage, but they allow for the use of nulls for keys and values and are not thread-safe.

# Thread-Safety and Hash Tables in Kotlin

- Thread-safe means that multiple threads can access and change a data structure without causing an error.
- Although hash maps in Kotlin are not thread-safe, it is possible to add code for synchronization and prevent nulls from being added as keys or values to create a thread-safe hash table.

# Hash Table Implementation in Python

- Similar to Kotlin, Python does not have a native implementation of a hash table, but a dictionary can be used as a substitute.
- Dictionaries in Python store key-value pairs, use hashable keys as memory storage indicators, and are already thread-safe, making them a suitable choice for implementing a hash table.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, hash tables are a useful data structure for quick lookups and storage of key-value pairs. Although not all programming languages have built-in implementations, it is possible to create hash tables by altering existing data structures such as hash maps in Kotlin or dictionaries in Python.
