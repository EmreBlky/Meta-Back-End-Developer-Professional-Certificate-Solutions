# Basic Data Structures

- You started the module by learning about basic data structures, including strings, Booleans, arrays, collections, graphs, and heaps.
- You learned about the difference between immutable and mutable structures and the importance of choosing the right structure for your data.

# Linear Data Structures

- You learned about the different types of linear structures, including arrays, queues, stacks, and lists.
- You gained an understanding of how each structure is attached to the previous element and the traversal of data in a linear structure.

# Non-Linear Data Structures

- You learned about non-linear structures, including trees and graphs, and the exploration of paths in these structures.

# Lists and Sets

- You learned about lists and sets, including mixed element types, dynamic structures, and how sets store elements in an unordered way.

# Linked Lists

- You learned about linked lists, which contain data and a pointer to the next item, and how they work.

# Hash Functions and Sets

- You learned about hash functions, their role in searching and sets, and the advantage of using hash tables.
- You gained an understanding of collisions in hashing, how the hash function maps keys to values, and the use of hash tables for efficient searching and storing data.

# Stacks and Queues

- You learned about stacks and queues, including the FILO (first in, last out) and FIFO (first-in, first-out) principles, and the methods for adding and removing elements.

# Trees

- You learned about trees, including the structure of trees, how data moves in a tree, and the benefits of using trees for data organization.

# Advanced Data Structures

- You learned about hash tables, including the structure, features, advantages, and indexing of hash tables.
- You learned about heaps, including the organization of elements, the limiting of functionality for increased productivity, and the insertion, finding, and deleting of items in a heap.

# Graphs

- You learned about graphs, including the representation of locations and their connectedness, directed and undirected graphs, weakly and strongly connected edges, and the key concepts of graphs.

# Quizzes

- You completed quizzes on all the topics covered in this module, making you more equipped for your future.

# Conclusion

Congratulations on a job well done! Good luck with the next module.
