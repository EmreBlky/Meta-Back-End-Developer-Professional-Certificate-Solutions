# Graphs

# Introduction

When solving a problem in computer science, it's important to consider the necessary operations to find a solution. This includes choosing the right data structure to store your data. For example, imagine working for a large internet company that wants to store a directory of locations and their connections to each other. In this scenario, you can use a graph-based approach to model the relationships between the locations.

# What is a graph?

- A graph is a data structure that consists of nodes and edges that represent destinations and relationships between them. The presence of values between the nodes makes it a weighted graph. If there are no arrows present, it is considered an undirected graph, meaning there is no order of precedence between the nodes.
- A graph can also be compared to a tree, but with a more complex structure that has no beginning or end. Two nodes connected by an edge are called neighbors, and nodes connected through a neighbor are considered adjacent.
- Graphs can be traversed using either a breadth-first or depth-first approach.

# Breadth-first and Depth-first traversal

- A breadth-first traversal involves starting at a given node and iterating over all its neighbors. The neighbors and their connected nodes can be added to a queue to ensure a systematic visit to every node.
- A depth-first traversal, on the other hand, involves using a stack to process the elements. Unlike a queue, which prioritizes first-in, first-out, a stack focuses on last-in, last-out. By placing all the neighbor nodes systematically on a stack, you can ensure a depth-first traversal.

# Shortest Path and the Traveling Salesman Problem

Graphs are commonly used to solve problems such as finding the shortest path between two nodes or the best route for a traveling salesman to visit multiple nodes. These problems are solved by considering the edge weights and finding the most efficient path with the least cost of resources.

```python
Undirected Graph:
A--B--C
 \    |
  \   |
   \  |
     D

Weighted Graph:
A--5--B--3--C
 \     |
  \2   |
   \   |
    \--D
```

# Conclusion

In this video, you learned about graphs and how they can be used to model data in a flexible and efficient way. By only retaining the minimum amount of information, you can easily query different questions without changing the data. Graphs have a whole field of statistics devoted to inferring information from node placements, making it a versatile approach to storing data.
