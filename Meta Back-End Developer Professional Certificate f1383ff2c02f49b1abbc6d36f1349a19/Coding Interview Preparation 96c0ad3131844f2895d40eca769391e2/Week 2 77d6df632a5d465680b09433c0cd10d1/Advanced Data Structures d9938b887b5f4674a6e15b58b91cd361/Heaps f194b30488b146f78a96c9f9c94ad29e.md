# Heaps

# ****What is a Heap?****

A heap is a specialized data structure that resembles a tree-like structure, but operates like a queue, with the added functionality of assigning priority to elements. Elements in a heap have a key value, and the priority can be either the smallest or the largest key value.

- Min Heap: A heap that prioritizes the lowest valued key.
- Max Heap: A heap that prioritizes the highest valued key

# ****Operations in a Heap****

A heap has a few core operations it can perform:

- Min Heap: Insert, Find Min, and Delete Min
- Max Heap: Insert, Find Max, and Delete Max

In this section, we will focus on Min Heaps, but the same concepts can be applied to Max Heaps with the only difference being the priority placement.

# ****Insertion in a Min Heap****

Insertion in a Min Heap is achieved through propagation. Each item is inserted at the root and then compared to the left value. If the left value is less than the newly inserted item, they are swapped. This process continues until the newly inserted item has no greater value above it and the value below is lower.

```python
Example:
Inserting 3 into the Min Heap:
        3
       / \
      2   5
```

```python
After insertion:
        2
       / \
      3   5
```

Insertion in a Min Heap can be achieved in O(log n) time.

# ****Find Min in a Min Heap****

The minimum value in a Min Heap is always stored at the root node. Retrieving the minimum value is O(1) because it is stored at the root node.

```python
Example:
Min Heap:
        2
       / \
      3   5

Find Min: 2
```

# ****Delete Min in a Min Heap****

The delete_min method can be called if the intention is to remove the minimum item from the heap. However, deleting items in a heap requires restructuring the tree, leading to a decline in performance.

```python
Example:
Min Heap:
        2
       / \
      3   5

Delete Min (2):
        3
       / \
      5
```

# ****Applications of Heaps****

Heaps are useful in scheduling and prioritizing tasks. For example, in interview scheduling, the key used to store the candidate may relate to the stage of the interview process they are in or the priority of the role within the organization.

```python
Example:
Min Heap with Interview Scheduling:
        2 (candidate 2 at stage 2)
       / \
      1 (candidate 1 at stage 1)  3 (candidate 3 at stage 3)
```

# Conclusion

In conclusion, heaps are a useful data structure for organizing elements based on priority. By limiting the functionality, productivity can be increased. It's important to choose the right tool for the job when selecting a data structure.
