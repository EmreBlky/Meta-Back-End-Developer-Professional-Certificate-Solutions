# Heaps and graphs in different programming languages

# Introduction

In this reading, we will dive into the world of graphs and heaps, two important data structures in computer science. Understanding the properties and use cases of these data structures can help you solve problems in a more efficient and effective way.

# Terminology

## Graphs

Graphs are non-linear data structures that consist of nodes and edges. 

A graph can be directed, where the edges have a specific direction, or undirected, where the connections are bidirectional.

### Nodes

Nodes store the data, and edges are connections between two nodes. 

### Edges

Edges can have weights, which are values that represent the strength of the connection between two nodes. 

## NetworkX

NetworkX is a Python library that can be used to model and analyze graphs. It supports a wide range of graph-based algorithms, including distance metrics, centrality, and clique detection. NetworkX can also be visualized using Python's matplotlib library for better insights into the data.

# Heaps

- Sorted information to quickly return min and max values
- Binary approach with a maximum of two nodes
- O(1) lookup time
- Root node holds the largest or smallest value
- Insertion of a new element requires comparison and movement of surrounding elements to ensure it is placed in the correct position
- Some languages, like Kotlin or Javascript, represent heaps using an array list
- Efficacy of heaps depends on the underlying data structure used

# Conclusion

- Graphs and heaps are data structures that allow us to infer connections from the data stored.
- Heaps can be seen as a specialized type of graph.

In this reading, we learned about graphs and heaps, two important data structures in computer science. 

Graphs consist of nodes and edges and can be used to model and analyze data. 

Heaps are specialized graphs that place special importance on the topmost element and are used for quick lookups of the minimum or maximum value. Understanding the properties and use cases of these data structures can help you solve problems in a more efficient and effective way.
