# About the final graded assessment

# **The purpose of the graded assessment**

The main purpose of a graded assessment is to check your knowledge and understanding of the key learning objectives of the course you have just completed. Most importantly, graded assessments help you establish which topics you have mastered and which require further focus before completing the course.

Ultimately, this graded assessment is designed to help you make sure that you are ready for the next course in this program.

# **Prepare for the graded assessment**

As you have progressed through this course, you have encountered knowledge checks, in-video questions and other assessments. Nothing in the final graded assessment will be outside what you have covered already, so you should be well-placed to succeed.

# **Review the graded assessment**

Please review the feedback and, where necessary, go back and work through the topics that require your further attention.

Good luck!
