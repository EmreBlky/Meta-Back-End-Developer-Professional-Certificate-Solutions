## **Question 1: What are soft skills?**

- They relate to the way you conduct yourself socially.
- Not necessarily coding skills that improve the presentation of code.
- Skills that you would feel competent at.

```python
Correct Answer: They relate to the way you conduct yourself socially.
```

During a coding interview, the interviewer is interested in knowing how you will function in a team. Hence, they might ask you questions related to your soft skills.

## **Question 2: When are you most likely to be asked about your soft skills?**

- During a screening call.
- During a quiz.
- During a technical interview.

```python
Correct Answer: During a screening call.
```

The screening call is designed to identify whether a candidate is a good fit for a companyâ€™s culture. This is done before any competency is established.

## **Question 3: What is the purpose of the online coding assignment?**

- To give you an opportunity to show what you can produce in an unpressurized environment that mimics potential job activities you will be asked to undertake.
- To help you get into the mindset of working for this company before you start
It is to get you to solve some company problem
- To help you get into the mindset of working for this company before you start

```python
Correct Answer: To give you an opportunity to show what you can produce in an unpressurized environment that mimics potential job activities you will be asked to undertake.
```

The role of the coding assignment is to demonstrate your thought process and your hands-on coding ability.

## **Question 4: Pseudocode is a structured way to engage with code.**

- False
- True

```python
Correct Answer: False
```

Though using pseudocode can help you find the structure in code, it has no formalized way or structure for engaging with it.

## **Question 5: When should you test your code?**

- Continuously as the project progresses.
- At the end.
- Whenever the application crashes to identify what the issue is.

```python
Correct Answer: Continuously as the project progresses.
```

Ideally, the code should be tested as you go.
