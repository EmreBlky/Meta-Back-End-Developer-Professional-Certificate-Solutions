# What is a coding interview?

A technical interview is a crucial step in demonstrating your coding skills and technical abilities to a potential employer. Before the interview, you will have likely completed a screening process that assessed your soft skills and communication abilities. The technical interview is designed to determine if you are technically capable of fulfilling the responsibilities of the role.

Here are some steps to keep in mind when preparing for a technical interview:

# ****Prepare to Succeed****

- Many candidates may feel nervous about technical interviews, but there are steps you can take to prepare for success.
- Remember, failing to prepare is preparing to fail.

# ****Solve the Problem Conceptually First****

- Before employing a solution, take some time to understand the problem and what the answer should look like.
- Jot down the major points of the problem and outline a potential solution using pseudocode.
- Show the interviewer your ability to reason through a problem and engage with problem-solving.

# ****Employ Appropriate Tools****

- The problems presented in a coding interview are designed to test your problem-solving abilities and your familiarity with available tools.
- Utilize existing data structures, sorting and searching algorithms, and minimize the code required.
- Familiarize yourself with staple structures, such as dictionaries, arrays, and more.

# ****Optimize the Solution****

- Optimize your code to minimize memory usage and CPU time.
- Outline your solution's time and space complexity and see if you can improve it.
- Modularize your code, reuse code when possible, and avoid excessive compiler calls.

# ****Practice Makes Perfect****

- Prepare for technical interviews by doing practice solutions to online problems.
- When possible, employ a similar methodology to each challenge so that you have a comfortable framework to work from.

# ****Stay Calm and Think Logically****

- A coding interview may seem daunting, but stay calm and think logically.
- Even if you are not familiar with the problem or do not achieve a solution in the time allotted, always strive to demonstrate your reasoning and best-practice approaches.

# ****Example: Count the Socks Problem****

One example of a common technical interview problem is the "count the socks" problem. You are given an array that represents sock colors, where yellow socks are represented by 1, blue socks by 2, red socks by 3, green socks by 4, and orange socks by 5.

```python
sock_colors = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 5, 1, 4, 4]
```

The goal is to determine how many pairs of the same color socks exist.

```python
from collections import Counter

def count_socks(sock_colors):
    # 1. Create a dictionary where the keys are the unique values in `sock_colors` and the values are their frequency.
    sock_count = Counter(sock_colors)
    # sock_count = {1: 4, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 1}
    
    # 2. Initialize a variable `pairs` to keep track of the number of pairs.
    pairs = 0
    
    # 3. Iterate over the values in `sock_count`.
    for count in sock_count.values():
        # 4. For each count, increment `pairs` by the integer division of `count` by 2.
        pairs += count // 2
    
    # 5. Return the final value of `pairs`.
    return pairs

# 6. Call the function with the input `sock_colors`.
print(count_socks(sock_colors))
```

**Output**:

```python
4
```

In this example, **`sock_colors`** is a list of integers representing the color of each sock. The function **`count_socks`** uses the **`Counter`** class from the **`collections`** module to create a dictionary **`sock_count`** where the keys are the unique values in **`sock_colors`** and the values are their frequency. 

The function then initializes a variable **`pairs`** to keep track of the number of pairs of socks, and iterates over the values in **`sock_count`**, incrementing **`pairs`** by the integer division of each count by 2. This way, the number of pairs is equal to the floor of half of the frequency of each color. Finally, the function returns the final value of **`pairs`**, which in this case is 4.
