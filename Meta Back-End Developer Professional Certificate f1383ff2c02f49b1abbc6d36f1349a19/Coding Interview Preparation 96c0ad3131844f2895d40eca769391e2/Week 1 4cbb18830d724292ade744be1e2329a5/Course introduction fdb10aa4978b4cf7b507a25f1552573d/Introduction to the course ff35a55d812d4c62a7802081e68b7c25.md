# Introduction

Welcome to this coding interview preparation course! This course will help you prepare for the unique and challenging aspects of a coding interview, including:

- Problem-solving approaches
- Computer Science Foundations
- Communication skills

# ****Key Concepts and Skills****

## ****Module 1: Understanding Coding Interviews****

In this module, you will learn about:

- What a coding interview is and what it can consist of
- Types of coding interviews you may encounter
- How to prepare yourself for a coding interview, including:
    - Communication (e.g. explaining your thought process, handling mistakes, the star method)
    - Pseudocode (demonstrating how you might reach a solution)
    - Tips for practical solution design and testing

## Module 2: ****Computer Science Fundamentals****

In this module, you will get an introduction to computer science and learn about:

- Binary and its relation to real-life hardware and computing
- Memory (RAM and ROM) and how computers use it to perform tasks, process information, and store data
- Time complexity (Big-O notation and types of Big-O notation)
- Space complexity (space required to compute a result)

## Module 3: Data Structures

In this module, you will learn about:

- Basic data structures (strings, integers, Booleans, arrays, objects)
- Collection data structures (lists, sets, stacks, queues, trees)
- Advanced data structures (hash tables, heaps, graphs)

## Module 4: ****Algorithms****

In this module, you will get an introduction to algorithms and learn about:

- Types of algorithms available
- Sorting algorithms (selection sort, insertion sort, quicksort)
- Searching algorithms (time and space complexity)
- Divide and conquer, recursion, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms

# ****Conclusion****

In the last module, you will have the chance to recap everything you've learned before taking the graded course quiz. This quiz will test you on all of the key concepts and skills you have learned throughout the course.

Now, let's get started!
