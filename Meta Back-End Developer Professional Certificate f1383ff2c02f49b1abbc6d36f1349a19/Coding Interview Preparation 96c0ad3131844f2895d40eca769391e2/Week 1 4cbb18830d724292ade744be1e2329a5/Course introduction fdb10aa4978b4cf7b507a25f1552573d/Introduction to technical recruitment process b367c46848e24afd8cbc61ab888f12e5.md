Finding a job as a software engineer in tech hub cities in the US can take approximately 39 months. The interviews you will face will sometimes include skills that you don't use in your day-to-day job. It's not just about how well you can program, but also about your interpersonal skills, ability to drive projects, and collaborate with others. You don't need to worry about dressing up in a suit, just be yourself and focus on the technical aspects of the interview.

- Application process
