# Binary

# Introduction

In this guide, you'll learn about binary numbers and how computers use them to represent human language. You'll also learn about ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, and how it maps binary to text.

# Positional Notation

Just like humans count using base ten (0-9), computers use binary, which is a base-two system (0 and 1). Positional notation is used to denote the value of a number based on its position in a sequence. In binary, each time the count of 0s and 1s is exhausted, a new digit is added to the left, and the count starts over.

## Example

Starting with 0, add 1 to get 1.

Next, start at 0 again and add 1 to the left to get 10.

Again, start at 0 and add 1 to the left to get 11.

The next step would be to add 1 to the left of the first 1, making it 100.

# Binary in computing

Binary is a convenient way to translate electricity into computer code. If a signal is present, a 1 is displayed; otherwise, a 0 is used. A byte is made up of eight bits that can either be 0 or 1, allowing for 256 different combinations in each byte.

# ASCII

ASCII maps binary to character encoding or text. There is a binary number reserved for each digit and character, as well as for special characters like the question mark, brackets, full stop, and even the space bar.

## Example

Here's a sample of ASCII character encoding:

| Character | ASCII Code (Binary) | ASCII Code (Decimal) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | 01000001 | 65 |
| B | 01000010 | 66 |
| C | 01000011 | 67 |

# Exponentiation

Exponentiation is used to determine the number of states a binary representation can hold. For example, if you have a lock with four digits, each digit can be either 0 or 1. The number of possible combinations for the lock is 2 to the power of 4, which is 16.

## Example

Two to the power of three (2^3) is 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.

# Summary

Binary is the language of computers, and understanding it is essential in understanding how data is stored and processed. Through the use of positional notation, binary can represent an infinite number of values, making it a powerful tool in computing. 

Additionally, ASCII allows for the mapping of binary to text, making it an important aspect of data representation and storage. By counting the power of a number, you can determine the number of unique states a binary representation can hold, providing a deeper understanding of the power of binary in computing.
