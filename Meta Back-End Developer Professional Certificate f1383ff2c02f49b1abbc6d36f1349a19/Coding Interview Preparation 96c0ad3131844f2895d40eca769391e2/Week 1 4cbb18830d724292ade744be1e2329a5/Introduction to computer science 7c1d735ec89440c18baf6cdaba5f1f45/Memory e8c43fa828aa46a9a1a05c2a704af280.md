# Memory

# Introduction

In this video, you will learn about the different types of memory used in computers, and how they interact with the central processing unit (CPU).

# Cache Memory

- Quick and expensive form of memory, located close to the CPU
- When the CPU receives an instruction to process information, it first checks the cache
- If the information is available, it is processed, otherwise, it is queried from main memory
- Improves the system by reducing the search and transfer time of regularly used data
- Organized in zones of importance, with the most important information in zone 1

# ****Main Memory****

- Consists of Read Access Memory (RAM) and Read Only Memory (ROM)
- RAM holds current data and instructions in use, and can retain new information
- ROM holds critical instructions for the computer's function, but cannot be altered
- The amount of RAM directly affects the computer's speed, as it determines how many applications can be run at once

# ****Secondary Memory****

- External memory used to increase storage capacity
- Slower and requires transferring all required information and instructions into RAM
- Examples: cloud storage, external hard drives, memory sticks

# Conclusion

In this video, you learned about the different types of memory in computers, how they interact with the CPU, and how they vary in speed and importance. Understanding these concepts will give you a greater understanding of how your computer works.
