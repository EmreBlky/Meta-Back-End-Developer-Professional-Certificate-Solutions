# Divide and conquer

# Introduction

The divide and conquer paradigm offers a useful framework for problem-solving that incorporates two principles: recursion and breaking problems down into smaller problems.

# Paradigm

- The algorithm consists of two mandatory steps: divide and conquer, and an optional third step: combine.
- Divide: The input is split into smaller segments and processed individually.
- Conquer: Every task associated with a given segment is solved.
- Combine (optional): All the solved segments are combined.

# Example: Merge Sort

- Merge sort is a sophisticated approach for sorting an array that employs the divide and conquer paradigm.
- The array is halved until there is only one element remaining, then the process is reversed, and each smaller list is sorted before rejoining the part it was halved from.
- Real-world example: Imagine you and your housemates are shopping together and you divide the shopping list into smaller parts for each person to complete in a shorter time.

# **Advantages of Divide and Conquer**

- Parallelism: Different threads or computers can work on the same problem at the same time, making the process quicker.
- Memory Management: The data being processed can be sent to different cores or servers, and some of the problems can be exported to online servers to manage available memory.

# Conclusion

- In this video, you learned about the divide and conquer paradigm, its mandatory and optional steps, and how it is applied to the merge sort example.
- You also learned about the advantages of divide and conquer, including parallelism and memory management, and how it can be applied to real-world computer optimization.
