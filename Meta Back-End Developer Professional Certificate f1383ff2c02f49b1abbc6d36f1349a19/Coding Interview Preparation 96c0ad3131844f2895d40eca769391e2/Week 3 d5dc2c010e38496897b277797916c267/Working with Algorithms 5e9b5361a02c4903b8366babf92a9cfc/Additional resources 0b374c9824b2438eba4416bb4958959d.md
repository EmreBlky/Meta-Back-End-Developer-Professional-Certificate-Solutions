# Additional resources

Here are some additional resources for learning more about working with algorithms:

- This article provides a comprehensive breakdown of various [algorithms](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/index.html) that are graph specific. In this article, you will gain both an understanding of the data structure as well as insights into its implementation.
- This article discusses [space complexity](https://algodaily.com/lessons/understanding-space-complexity). In it, you will find a comparison between implementing iterative solutions versus recursive ones.
- This article explains what [recursion](https://web.mit.edu/6.031/www/fa20/classes/16-recursive-data-types/) is and which datatypes are most congenial for its implementation.
