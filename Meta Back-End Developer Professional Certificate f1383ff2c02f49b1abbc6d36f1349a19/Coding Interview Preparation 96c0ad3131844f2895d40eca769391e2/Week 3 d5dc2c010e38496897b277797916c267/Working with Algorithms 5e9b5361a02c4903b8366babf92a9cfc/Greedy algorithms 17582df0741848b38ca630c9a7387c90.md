# Greedy algorithms

# Introduction

- In this video, you will learn about the greedy algorithm approach to solving complex problems.
- The greedy algorithm is a simple solution that seeks an immediate solution for a task, favoring local optimization over a global approach.

# ****Occam's Razor and Greedy Algorithm****

- The principle of Occam's Razor states that the simplest solution is often the best one.
- The greedy algorithm is a simple solution that solves problems by selecting the most immediate or rewarding option.

# ****Differences between Dynamic Programming and Greedy Algorithm****

- Dynamic programming seeks to find a globally optimal solution by breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and selecting the best subset to implement.
- A greedy algorithm, on the other hand, begins with a local optimization by selecting the most rewarding option and disregards the impact on other options.

# Example of CPU Task Allocation

- Imagine a CPU with a list of tasks to be completed.
- A dynamic programming approach would find the most efficient subset of tasks that can be completed within a given time.
- A greedy approach would simply select the shortest running task first and then the next shortest, without considering the impact on other tasks.

# ****Shortest Path Problem****

- Consider the problem of finding the shortest path on a map with nine nodes, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and S, connected by weighted paths.
- A dynamic programming approach would create a table and calculate each potential node from the starting point, using memoization to save time on subsequent journeys.
- A greedy approach would start at the starting node and look at each available connection, selecting the path with the lowest weight.

# ****Pros and Cons of Greedy Algorithm****

- The overhead for a greedy algorithm is low and coding a solution is straightforward.
- However, it does not always guarantee the best solution, as it only considers the most immediate or rewarding option.

# ****Conclusion****

- You have learned about the greedy algorithm approach and its differences from dynamic programming.
- The next time you use a navigation tool, consider the selection of routes offered and think about how they might have been calculated using greedy algorithms.
