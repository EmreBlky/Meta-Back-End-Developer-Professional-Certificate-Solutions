# Additional resources

Here are some additional resources for learning more about sorting and searching algorithms:

- Here is an article on [Time and space complexity of selection sort](https://iq.opengenus.org/time-complexity-of-selection-sort/). It includes an implementation of selection sort and how one can calculate the complexity involved.
- Here is an article about [Quick-sort](https://www.commonlounge.com/quick-sort-video-tutorial-pseudo-code-and-in-place-sorting-608c5c7284b148eb9d550e6166303142/) with a video tutorial and pseudocode. It provides a detailed analysis of various sorting algorithms, comparisons and further links to video explanations.
