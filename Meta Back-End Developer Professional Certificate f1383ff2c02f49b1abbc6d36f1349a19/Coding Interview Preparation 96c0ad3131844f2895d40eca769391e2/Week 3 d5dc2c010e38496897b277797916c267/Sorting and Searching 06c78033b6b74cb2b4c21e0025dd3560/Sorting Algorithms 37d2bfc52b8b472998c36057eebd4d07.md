# Sorting Algorithms

# Introduction

Sorting data may seem simple, but it can be quite complex when you dive into the details. In this lesson, you'll learn about sorting algorithms and the different methods available to you. You'll be introduced to linear and binary searching and learn how to implement them. You'll also learn about the steps involved in implementing Selection, Insertion, and Quicksort sorting and understand the strengths and weaknesses of each.

# ****Linear and Binary Searching****

## Linear searching

Linear searching is straightforward and mimics how a human might approach a problem. The algorithm starts by searching through a list to find the smallest element and then switches it with the first element. This process is repeated for every element in the list until the list is ordered from smallest to largest.

## Binary searching

Binary searching is also straightforward and begins by examining the first two elements in a list. The smaller of the two is moved to the front. This process is repeated for every element, with each element being compared to the element on its left and a switch being made if it's found to be smaller.

# Selection Sort

Selection sort is a straightforward approach to sorting. The algorithm starts by searching through a list to find the smallest element and then switches it with the first element. This process is repeated for every element in the list until the list is ordered from smallest to largest.

# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is another straightforward approach to sorting. It begins by examining the first two elements in a list and moving the smaller of the two to the front. This process is repeated for every element, with each element being compared to the element on its left and a switch being made if it's found to be smaller.

# Quicksort

Quicksort is a more sophisticated approach to sorting that is more complex to implement but shows far greater efficiency. The algorithm operates on the principle of pivots. The algorithm selects an element in the array as the pivot and then moves all items larger than this value to the right of the pivot and all elements less than this value to the left. This process is repeated for both sides of the pivot until all the items are sorted.

# ****Choosing the Right Sorting Algorithm****

There are many sorting algorithms available and each has its own trade-offs. The most efficient algorithm will vary depending on the problem at hand. It's important to understand how each algorithm works so you can choose the best one for your needs. 

**In practice, you probably wouldn't write your own implementations as there are excellent implementations in every language.**

In this lesson, you've learned about sorting algorithms and the different methods available to you. You've also learned about the steps involved in implementing Selection, Insertion, and Quicksort and discovered the strengths and weaknesses of each sorting approach.
